resumption of the session 
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 21 september 2000 . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
the minutes of the sitting on thursday , 21 september have been distributed . 
are there any comments ? 
madam president , i shall keep to the subject of the minutes . 
for some strange reason , my name is missing from the register of attendance . 
i would ask you to correct this and would at the same time take the opportunity to point out that it has been possible today to come here to strasbourg from finland in just nine hours . 
that is almost a personal record for me this autumn ! 
yes indeed , mrs thors , we shall amend the minutes accordingly . 
( the minutes were approved ) 
presidency communication on the situation in the middle east 
ladies and gentlemen , in the last few days , as you know , jerusalem , other towns and the palestinian territories have been thrown into a state of unrest , and there have already been many victims . 
earlier today , helicopters bombed targets in gaza , thereby making the situation worse . 
i should like , on behalf of the european parliament , to express my deepest outrage at this new outbreak of violence , and to express our heartfelt sympathy with the families of the victims in their sorrow and suffering . 
as this sad state of affairs shows , the status of jerusalem is one of the keys to peace in the middle east . 
the city bears the weight of powerful symbols for all three monotheistic religions . 
attacking such symbolism is tantamount to rejecting the will for peace and hindering the search for a solution that is acceptable to all parties . 
we do , however , know that , on both sides , there are men of peace who wish to forge ahead . 
the joint visit by mr ahmed qurie and mr avraham burg , speaker of the palestinian legislative council and speaker of the knesset respectively , in this house during our september part - session proved this once again . 
on the matter of jerusalem , they displayed an open - mindedness and a willingness to listen that gave us hope . 
as this part - session of the european parliament opens , i call on the international community to do all it can to piece together the threads of dialogue as soon as possible . 
madam president , on behalf of the socialist group , i would first of all like to support your words and express our complete agreement with them . 
please allow me to propose , on behalf of my group , that this very important issue , which involves the responsibilities of the european union , as you have correctly pointed out , be included in the debate which we are going to hold tomorrow in connection with the biarritz summit . 
the situation in the middle east will clearly be one of the issues dealt with at this summit , even though it is informal . 
i would also like to stress , as you have rightly pointed out , that there has been unacceptable provocation by a leader of the israeli extreme right known for his extremist activities in the past . 
i also believe that we must address our israeli friends in the frankest possible terms and tell them that a democratic and legitimate government , such as theirs , cannot use gunfire and tanks to fight children and youths throwing stones . 
this is absolutely disproportionate and in no way helps the peace process . 
madam president , i believe that , after the visi. on your invitatio. of the presidents of the israeli and palestinian assemblies last month , we have sufficient moral legitimacy to address our partners in the middle east in the strongest terms , while offering them our services . 
madam president , i sent you a letter on behalf of my group requesting an amendment to the agenda on the issue which you have just addressed in a most dignified way . 
since mr barón crespo has raised the subject , let me make my point on the matter immediately . 
in my opinion , since parliament issued a very timely joint invitation to the speakers of the knesset and the palestinian legislative council a month ago , specifically in order to indicate its willingness to become involved in promoting the peace process , we cannot , as members of this parliament , remain silent today . 
in words with which i identify completely , you described the tragic situation developing right now in palestine and in israel . 
i fully understand that , tomorrow , mr prodi , the council , and ourselves , or some of us , will be speaking in the general debate . 
we cannot , however , possibly limit ourselves to dealing with this tragic matter alongside a number of other very important matters , thus making it possible for a first person to discuss the charter , the next to discuss the french presidency and the biarritz summit , a third to bring up the danish ' no ' vote in the referendum on emu , and only then have a fourth , on the subject of the middle east . 
this would not do justice to the matter . 
my group and i therefore suggest that , tomorrow if possible , or another day if necessary , we look into finding a way to devote an hour to this extremely important subject , and to adopt a resolution . 
it this were to prove impossible , i suggest that we should at least have a question on the subject in our topical and urgent debate . 
in any event , i would expressly ask that we make it impossible for anyone at the end of this part - session to claim that parliament as such did not follow up your splendid statement and declare itself in favour of a return to peace in israel and in the middle east . 
ladies and gentlemen , if you agree , i shall introduce a sort of procedural motion . 
we have not yet moved on to the discussion of the agenda . 
i did receive the request you sent me . 
i suggest discussing whether or not we should enter this subject on the order of business for tuesday when we move on to the agenda . 
in the meantime , i have to deal with a series of procedural motions , which we shall finish first . 
i have a few statements to make to you , after which we shall discuss the agenda . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the events in the middle east are a real tragedy . 
i am very grateful to you for raising this subject . 
my group fully supports the substance of what you have said . 
madam president , my group is also , naturally , extremely shocked by the events that took place over the weekend in the middle east . 
of all the proposals that have been made , i would like to offer my support primarily for that of my colleague , mr wurtz , to find a suitable point in time when we can ask the counci. and possibly also the commissio. to propose a resolution . 
it would also suit our group if parliament were to make its own statement regarding this issue . 
thank you , mr sterckx , we take note of your statement . 
madam president , i wish to speak on a completely different subject , but as this parliament knows , the convention entrusted with the task of drafting the charter of fundamental rights of the european union has just completed its work , and this is cause for satisfaction . 
yet , while our own institution has done so much to ensure the successful completion of the work of the convention , particularly by , on many occasions , making its premises available to the convention , i am sorry that today , as our plenary part - session in strasbourg is opening , it was not possible to organise the formal hand over of this charter here in strasbourg , in conditions worthy of it , now that the work of drafting it has been completed . 
in my view , this would have been a powerful , symbolic act for our institution , and i think it is a pity . 
madam president , as chairman of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism and as a greek member of parliament , i wish to raise the subject of the sinking of the express samina last tuesday . 
so far there are 79 dead and 2 unaccounted for . 
before giving mr watts the floor to speak on the same subject , i would just like to inform you that directly after this dreadful disaster i did of course write to the president of the greek parliament , mr kaklamanis , in order to express , on behalf of the house , my deep sadness and our solidarity with the families of the victims . 
madam president , following the tragic events of last week in the aegean , yesterday 's suspension of over 60 greek passenger ships which do not comply with eu laws is , i am sure , welcomed by the whole house . 
in addition to passing on our condolence. which i am glad to note you already hav. and our gratitude to all those involved in the rescues in those tragic events , could the president ask next week 's committee on regional policy , transport and tourism to investigate why 79 people had to die before these ships were banned ? 
that committee needs to ask urgently why member states are ignoring eu maritime safety law. it is not just greece . 
we need to ask that committee to review why certain member states are granted lengthy opt - outs from those maritime safety laws . 
madam president , thank you for the message of sympathy which you sent the speaker of the greek parliament in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy in greek waters . 
it is true that there are shortcomings in the application of regulations both , national and european , and the greek government is addressing this matter with the utmost diligence . 
as far as the 65 ships which have been banned from sailing are concerned , we should , i think , clarify the fact that these ships would have been banned from sailing on 1 october anyway , even if 79 people had not died . 
these are two separate issues ; the imo regulations happened to expire on 1 october and , as a result , these ships were classified as unsuitable . 
i think , madam president , that this is too serious an issue for the opposition to capitalise on and it is too serious to be addressed in an urgent debate followed by a simple vote , which is why the socialist group will vote against entering it for urgent debate . 
this does not , of course , mean that we were not shocked by the tragedy or that , as a government and as the socialist group , we shall not do everything humanly possible to increase the safety of ships in the aegean , which has three and a half thousand islands and a huge number of ferries and , however serious this accident , compared with the number of voyages made in the aegean every summer , it is one accident out of a huge number of successful sailings . 
having said which , it is of course tragic , and the time has come to re - examine shipping conditions in greece and in europe in far greater detail ; but this does not mean that greek seas are any less safe than the seas of any other member state . 
madam president , in a comment on the danish ' no ' vote on the euro , you expressed the view that the ' no ' side had appealed to an irrational fear . 
if you had been better informed , you would have known that your description applies to only approximately 20 % of danes who voted ' no ' , and then only on a rough estimate . 
for the overwhelming majority of those who voted ' no ' , the vote was about democratic legitimacy to make decisions concerning our economic policy . 
madam president , thank you for the condolences which you sent on behalf of the european parliament ; you spoke for all of us . 
unfortunately , these 79 or 80 victims fell foul of large , profit - seeking shipowners . 
however much some people are trying to blame the crew , the fact remains that the vessel was over 35 years old , that it should not , in fact , have been sailing and that it sank extremely quickly , preventing more people from being saved . 
the unaccountability of shipowners is and always has been defended by successive greek governments . 
there are more than a hundred historic peoples in europe who can be classed as nations , and there are millions of people in europe who are nationalists and are devoted to their nation . 
madam president , after listening to my danish colleague , you can appreciate the fatuous level at which the debate was carried on in denmark , a debate which led to a ' no ' vote . 
however , a decision was made , and we must respect this . 
i shall of course do so , mr davies . 
madam president , the racist incidents in germany since the last part - session sadly mean that i have to raise this issue again . 
if , however , mr wurtz wishes to maintain his request regarding tuesday , then i shall ask for a speaker against the motion , and you are perfectly free to speak in this capacity . 
if mr wurtz proposes a compromise solution involving postponing his request until thursday , then that will conclude matters for the tuesday sitting . 
i think i am correct in saying that . 
mr maccormick , regarding the order of business for friday , your request was not delivered within the stipulated time limit and as a result , i must inform you now that it could not be taken into consideration . 
there are not , therefore , any amendments to the agenda for friday . 
nonetheless , i am still willing to give you the floor on a point of order if that is what you really want . 
madam president , i note on friday that the oral question on language teachers which came on our agenda extremely late has got no attached motion for a resolution . 
i appreciate that the request i put in for that to be added arrived too late in the rather chaotic circumstances of this monday . 
this is an important matter , and i would ask if after that debate closes a deadline can be fixed for motions for resolutions to be lodged on that topic . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i must firstly express my satisfaction at the proposed regulation on the principles for registers of taxes and social contributions in accordance with the criteria of the european system of national and regional accounts ( esa 95 ) . 
i say ' satisfaction ' because the approval of this regulation takes us closer to a transparent system which is comparable in the various member states in relation to the calculation of the public deficit . 
therefore , on the contrary , we will take the direction of seriousness in accounting in order to prevent behaviou. as i have sai. which is less than transparent , if not fraudulent . 
i therefore repeat that the joint position of the council must be supported , in my opinion , because this regulation introduces a mechanism for adapting to the european system of accounts 95 which ensures , effectively , comparability and transparency in the public accounting of the member states in areas as sensitive and important as those relating to the calculation of the public deficit . 
this approval also ensures that the right to request adaptation periods is counterbalanced by the right to reject such a period if it is not well founded . 
very often this is untrue , and there must have been some real conjuring tricks going on if a state is able to tell workers who have worked all their lives and have finally reached the point where they are entitled to their hard - earned , longed for pensions that there is no money left to pay them . 
this is a lie : the accounts have been fiddled . 
so roll on the adoption of the knörr borràs report ! 
mr president , firstly i would like to thank all the speakers for their comments . 
it is clear that the aim of this action , as mr fatuzzo has said , is to try to ensure that the figures correspond to reality as far as possible and that there is no underestimation of national public deficits . 
the work carried out by parliament and the council has been enormously useful . 
the commission fully approves the joint position of the council , which now includes the various amendments tabled by parliament at first reading . 
however , two points have been raised which to a certain extent are still to be clarified . 
the first one refers to article 7 ( 2 ) , that is , the possibility that the commission may have a certain margin for discretion with regard to the granting of transitional periods . 
in this case , all the commission requires is that those periods be genuinely justified . 
we are therefore perfectly able to accept that the commission should commit itself to granting these requests provided that the member states involved can objectively justify that it is difficult for them to immediately apply the provisions of the regulation . 
we believe that the game of clarity should apply on both sides . 
the commission clearly must not deny these periods when there is objective justification for them , but it is essential that the objective justifications exist if a transitional period is to be granted . 
otherwise , we would not be serving the objective of the regulation . 
the second point refers to the setting of vat and the calculation of vat own resources . 
with regard to the amendments which were presented at the time on this issue , the commission is clearly committed to taking a different route , since we have no difficulty with the basic idea . 
on this specific point , i would like to point out that the commission had committed itself on second reading to presenting another proposal for a european parliament and council regulation to deal with this specific issue , and today i can tell you that the commission approved its proposal on 20 september and it has been forwarded to parliament and the council . 
companies in the european union , especially in growth industries like the hi - tech and bio - tech industries , cannot achieve their full potential without better access to risk capital . 
efficient venture capital markets are also a precondition for the development of entrepreneurship in europe . 
in that sense i fully agree with mr skinner when he says that it is of the utmost importance to give smes open and fair access to the new risk capital markets . 
according to a recent study mentioned in the commission communication , this is also a very efficient tool for improving employment , since between 80 and 90 % of funds raised from venture capital normally go towards hiring more people ; in other words more risk capital allows us to use our human capital more efficiently . 
i therefore totally support parliament 's view on point 23, calling on the commission to keep us regularly informed about recent developments . 
the proposal for a directive on supplementary pension funds is essential for the growth of venture capital in europe . 
the employment and social committee wanted to make a reference to the findings of the recent report on supplementary pensions , particularly on the prudential rules . 
institutional investors such as insurance companies , investment funds and pension funds play an increasingly predominant role in providing risk capital . 
pension funds in particular have been gaining in importance in the last decade as the demographic changes increase the need for retirement products . 
the shift in favour of more performance - orientated instruments has also increased the need to reform the system . 
the developments over the last few days with the single currency have been unfortunate . 
we also want to see a tax system which at the same time promotes innovation and encourages private individuals to invest capital in businesses . 
i therefore also welcome the agreement reached in lisbon to introduce a benchmarking system so as to promote the best of the many ways of encouraging risk capital and to make further progress in this area . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr skinner , for his very prudent report , which comes just at a time when we need a fresh impetus in the risk capital sector within the european union . 
the acceleration in the pace of company growth , start - ups by highly innovative businesses and the terrific speed of industrial change all require more efficient risk capital markets . 
more support is needed for growth . 
although there has been rapid growth in venture capital here over the last five years , europe is still way behind the united states in this area , especially in the high - growth areas of information and biotechnology , and also in the area of health care , including preventive health care , a totally new field that is constantly growing . 
the committee on employment and social affairs took a special interest in types of supplementary pension funds and the prudential rules these require . 
because of increasing life expectancy , ever more new financial products are being created in the field of old - age pensions . 
this means that pension funds are playing an ever - greater role in providing risk capital . 
but social security systems , however they may be constructed , therefore particularly need special regulations and supervisory and codetermination bodies when it comes to funding , so as to strengthen confidence in these new systems and products . 
that is why it is also necessary for all interested partie. including the european parliament , the social partners , the european investment bank and the european investment fun. to participate in a continuing dialogue . 
it cannot be said often enough that the european union involves pooling our strengths . 
we must use all the financial instruments at our disposal to rapidly develop the market and to increase the volume of risk capital investment in the eu , so that risk capital is put to use in a way that genuinely creates jobs , thus benefiting all stakeholders . 
investing in new business start - ups will also create jobs . 
if these are to be successfully built up , employees will have a key role to play and will act as a driving force . 
employee participation systems linked with codetermination mechanisms therefore need to be in place . 
this is of vital importance for a variety of reasons . 
to sum up , i would like to emphasise once again that the commission communication , combined with the report , can potentially provide a strong impetus for combining forces in the risk capital sector . 
mr president , as we all know , the european parliament has , in successive reports and motions for many years now , expressed its interest in and sensitivity towards small and medium - sized enterprises and their problems . 
it has used various means to highlight the important role of small and medium - sized enterprises in creating jobs and introducing technological innovations . 
however , this much - vaunted interest on the part of the member states ' governments and the community institutions is pure hypocrisy since , to all intents and purposes , small and medium - sized enterprises are unable to access funding programmes , unable to take advantage of technological invention and technological modernisation programmes , unable to take advantage of staff education and training programmes and unable to do anything about their unfair treatment at the hands of the tax authorities . 
these problems could be addressed by revising the banks ' humiliating lending criteria and by making full use of associations of enterprises and chambers which promote technological development programmes and school education programmes . 
it is a public outrage to propose promoting a single european capital market , ostensibly to serve the interests of small and medium - sized enterprises . 
the same applies to proposals for single european pension funds , to proposals that insurance fund reserves be channelled into high - risk financial investments and to tax cuts on profits . 
certainly , solving problems in connection with the unfair treatment of small and medium - sized enterprises by the tax authorities , simplifying and modernising patents and reducing excessive administrative expenditure and start - up formalities for small and medium - sized enterprises are steps in the right direction . 
but we consider that satisfying the demands of big lenders in the name of small and medium - sized enterprises is provocative and we shall vote against it . 
i would urge the european commission to bring the process of adopting the directive on additional pensions to a conclusion . 
subject to rules of prudence , institutions must have complete freedom of investment . 
in addition , member states must ensure that paid pension contributions are exempt from tax so that a new source of private capital can be tapped . 
but the availability of capital is not the only threshold . 
often , it is the infamous web of rules and regulations , red - tape and formalities which stop small businesses from taking on staff . 
many member states thus have the major task of setting structural reform in motion and taking down unnecessary barriers . 
it should therefore be possible to submit an application in every official language of the union . 
i believe that , without a doubt , the equal treatment of languages de jure is in the interests of small , innovative businesses and also complies with the eu treaty . 
another concern , expresse. rightly so , in my opinio. in paragraph 22 of the motion for a resolution , relates to the possible patenting of natural materials , such as genes and plants . 
the principle that life is a gift of god and is not property acquired by people , should be respected at all times . 
mr president , the skinner report is to be welcomed . 
these are objectives that are repeatedly highlighted as being cornerstones , not only of our economic policy guidelines , but also of our employment policy guidelines . 
we are all aware of the problems involved , but we are faced with obstacles that seriously stand in the way of our taking a risk - based and entrepreneurial approach . 
i have in mind not only cultural barriers , but also red tape , approval and licensing procedures , difficulties for smes in simply filing patent applications and having patents granted , not to mention the cost of maintaining patents , and also uncoordinated tax systems . 
an entrepreneurial europe needs rewards and opportunities which benefit everyone . 
so we must fully support the demands that have been made . 
this amounts to a distortion of competition which puts public risk capital at a disadvantage . 
fourthly , how can you guarantee that the greater involvement by pension funds in risk capital called for in the report may not lead to pension contributions being lost , which would run counter to the contributors ' objective of ensuring a secure retirement ? 
fifthly , it remains unclear why mergers on the capital market should have a positive impact on the availability of risk capital . 
experience suggests the opposite . 
the fewer suppliers there are , the less competition there is and the higher costs are . 
i too should like to congratulate mr skinner on his excellent report , which addresses an issue that i consider to be of the utmost importance . 
if the european union wishes to establish itself as the most economically dynamic region in the world , as was decided at the lisbon summit , it must ensure that investments , particularly in smes , which create jobs and which support growth sectors , are given the necessary funding . 
we wish to promote a dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship in europe , but there are still countless difficulties blocking the path of people wanting to become entrepreneurs and to carry out profitable projects . 
the problems requiring rapid resolution throughout the european union range from the administrative aspects , such as the often pointless bureaucracy which wastes time , energy and money , to the provision of funding . 
venture capital companies have a major role to play in this field and the european union must make more rapid progress if it wishes to catch up , in particular with the united states , which is currently far ahead of us . 
first and foremost , europe needs to focus increasingly on the merit of projects rather than on the personal wealth of entrepreneurs , as still happens . 
if the banks ' practice of requiring personal guarantees from individuals is highly debatable , it is quite unacceptable where venture capital businesses are concerned . 
there is still a need to give entrepreneurs easier access to venture capital , and this requires much more active and efficient provision of information on the way in which it is used . 
( start of speech inaudible ) ... which will be of benefit only to that minority of the population which has capital to invest and move around . 
the package of proposals just provides one more illustration of the fact that the european union has been built exclusively in order to favour the movement and investment of large amounts of capital and , as a corollary , small amounts . 
yet this concerns the majority of the population , as it is their money that the european institutions count on using in order to fund the measures to facilitate private investment . 
the people who do not own capital but who pay the bulk of taxes , largely through indirect taxes such as vat , will therefore have to fund the subsidies and tax deductions envisaged for investors and the tax advantages granted to stock options . 
the plan is to favour pension funds , but that inevitably means favouring pay - as - you - go schemes . 
the money which ought to be used to provide a decent retirement pension for all will then be used to enable a minority to make greater private profits . 
remember though that the action plan for risk capital predates lisbon , since it dates back to 1998 . 
however , past circumstances do not matter as much as what we intend to do for the future . 
some of you have referred to two specific examples which i would like to highligh. pension funds and the possibility of a more effective community paten. which allow risk capital to be better used . 
as for pension funds , i will tell you that , this week in principle , the commission should approve a proposal for a directive which offers pension funds greater opportunities to invest in securities throughout the union . 
we are clearly talking about supplementary pension funds and not about an obligation to invest in this way . 
we are talking about removing the current obstacles and , therefore , there should be none of the problems you have mentioned with regard to future risks . 
clearly , the opening up to risk capital will require scrupulous behaviour on the part of managers so as to minimise any possible risks . 
with regard to the community patent , i simply wish to say that , back in july , the commission approved its proposal on this issue . 
some of you have mentioned the problem of public funding in the case of risk capital and we certainly have to clarify the compatibility of that public funding with all the legislation on competition . 
some of you wondered why public funding had to be merely a supplement to private funding . 
this is not a desire to exclude anything , but simply a desire to use the available resources in the best way . 
it is not reasonable for public funding to compete with private funding when it comes to financing risk capital projects , and we should use that public funding for those types of project which are most difficult to finance through the private sector . 
from the point of view of the union itself , we are considering the best way to use the available instruments , especially the european investment bank and the european investment fund . 
around the middle of october , the commission will also publish a second communication , which we will send to the council and parliament , in which we will analyse the various financial instruments managed by the commission and the future outlook on the essential issue of risk capital . 
in conclusion , i would say that i consider the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs to be an excellent and important contribution , and it is enormously constructive , in terms of the efforts to develop the risk capital market . 
even in those countries where it does operate it operates in a different way from the system across the atlantic . 
at the very least , issues like the pension fund can be introduced fairly quickly . 
thank you very much , mr solbes . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m . 
third asia - europe meeting in seoul , 20 - 21 october 2000 ( asem iii ) 
the next item is the commission statement on the third asia - europe meeting in seoul on 20 and 21 october ( asem iii ) . 
mr president , the third meeting of the asem process will take place in seoul in three weeks . 
it is a fortunate coincidence that the meeting is taking place in korea soon after the historic korean summit , which opened the way to reconciliation and future reunification . 
this will clearly have significant positive effects for security , not only regionally but also globally . 
this meeting will mark the maturing of a process which began four years ago in bangkok . 
this process complements our bilateral relations with our ten asian partners , as well as our relations with asean , and contributes to the process of integration in asia and in europe . 
the asem process is built on three pillars : the political , the economic and the cultural . 
the asem process has aided the asean + 3 process , bringing north and south - east asia even closer together . 
its structure of meetings between ministers for finance , economics and foreign affairs , as well as the summits , follow the asem model . 
in the union we also had to , and still have to , learn how to efficiently manage a process which seeks to promote political dialogue in order to deepen the economic relationship between the two regions and increase personal and cultural contacts . 
the process is based on a relationship of equality . 
by stressing the original idea that this process of dialogue should be developed as a process between equal partners and kept as informal as possible , without an institutionalised secretariat , we have managed , despite certain difficulties , to convince our asian partners that we wish to have equal relations with them , going beyond any donor - receiver relationship with them or any post - colonial standpoint . 
this approach is especially important in terms of our efforts to consolidate , deepen and broaden the political dialogue . 
while our asian partners prefer to deal with questions which unite us , excluding all others , we have argued for a broader agenda , excluding nothing . 
our partners have accepted this principle in return for a guarantee that wisdom and common sense will prevail when it comes to selecting the issues for discussion . 
human rights are most problematic , of course , together with the rejection of intervention in internal affairs and other arguments which are familiar to us . 
nevertheless , the statement by the presidency of the meeting and the framework for cooperation between asia and europe will clearly mention this problem . 
i would also like to add that , within the broader framework of the asem process , we are holding a constructive series of seminars on human rights organised jointly with the asia - europe foundation . 
security problems , which are of particular importance in the region , will play a considerable role in the process , and it is worth mentioning the publication of a separate declaration on the korean peninsular as an example of this . 
the leaders will also deal with the fight against cross - border crime , especially in the light of the recent dover tragedy . 
the exploitation of illegal immigrants , women and children , particularly in the virulent sex industry , will not only be a subject for debate , but also initiatives will be taken to combat this scourge of our times , which is linked to poverty and insecurity . 
in the field of the economy , 1993 was a significant year , since it was the critical moment when our exports to asia exceeded our exports to the united states . 
the second asem meeting , which took place in london in 1998, successfully overcame the crisis . 
we supported our asian partners and we adopted concrete measures , such as the significant commitment on trade and investments which reversed the earlier trend and led to a considerable commercial deficit with our partners . 
the creation of a trust fund , the establishment of a european financial network of experts and the adoption of two action plans to assist trade and promote investments are other concrete measures which show that europe is concerned about asia , not only in the good times but also in times of crisis . 
the coming meeting will allow us to assess the results of our efforts and confirm that we have made progress in the pursuit of greater operability and efficiency . 
furthermore , the leaders will discuss the implications of the new economy , globalisation , the lessons learnt from the crisis , the creation of a trans - european - asian superhighway to improve contacts between research institutes , and discuss the influence of the new technologies on economic life , including the measures to deal with the ever - greater knowledge gap . 
as a result of the current global situation , the availability of energy supply , including oil , has been added to the agenda . 
the need for a general , multilateral legal framework for the commercial system , such as the world trade organisation , and the need to keep it functioning in the era of globalisation , will also be a key issue in the leaders ' discussions . 
this is part of our strategy to make progress on the consensus in favour of an immediate start to a new global round . 
it is important to fill the cultural vacuum between our two regions . 
the need to increase awareness , to spread knowledge with a view to stimulating understanding , and eliminating false ideas have been important objectives of the asem process since its beginnings . 
the asia - europe foundation has contributed considerably to this objective . 
the leaders will therefore decide on other initiatives to increase the exchange of students between the regions , to modernise educational structures , to intensify cooperation in the development of human resources and exchange points of view on recent socio - political events . 
in this regard , we regret that our asian partners are still not prepared to consider the creation of a social forum , within the asem process , which represents civil society in the same way that the asia - europe business forum represents the business community . 
this proposal originates from the organisers of the forum of the peoples . 
from an organisational and logistical point of view , the korean presidency will publish a presidency statement which will addres. together with the problems discussed by the leader. issues such as the reform of the united nations , disarmament , arms control , the fight against aids etc . 
the final text will reflect the discussions between the leaders , but good work has already been carried out . 
therefore , the presidency will update it in accordance with its responsibilities during the meeting . 
the seoul declaration on the korean peninsula , which i mentioned before , recognises the importance of recent progress and approves the policy of introducing north korea into the international community with a view to the peaceful unification of the two koreas . 
finally , the 2000 framework for cooperation between europe and asia , an updated version of the first one , adopted at the last meeting in london , outlines the objectives and procedures which will govern the asem process over the next decade . 
in contrast to the last version , the importance of human rights and cooperation in safeguarding the environment have been added , to give just two examples . 
the only outstanding problem is the question of qualification for membership , with regard to which the european partners have so far been opposed to attempts to introduce certain limits which could be interpreted as excluding certain partners from future participation . 
so one of the most important things today is to make the european public aware of the asem process . 
however , our partners in asia do not understand that , in practice , we are very inward - looking . the issues that most concern us are the intergovernmental conference , enlargement and , when the occasion arises , problems on our political doorstep , such as the middle east . 
we must seize this opportunity and in fact this is a chance for us to win support for our principles there . 
this is something else that can be achieved through the asem process . 
mr president , i believe that the question is now no longer whether this century or this millennium will be a european one or an asian on. no , what matters is for both regions to join together in a new partnership . 
the exchanges between schools , universities and business people are most promising , and the asia - europe foundation is doing sterling work . 
however , what is at stake now , in 2000, is what asem can really achieve and should be able to achieve , and what is best organised at asem level . 
the vision group has produced an excellent model here , and one that should be put into more concrete terms . 
asem has certainly done the right thing in focusing on the three pillars of political , economic and cultural cooperation . 
the third point is political dialogue : asem is the ideal forum for raising issues , including disturbing ones . 
all matters of this kind should very definitely be raised . 
i would , however , urge all participants to reach a consensus on incorporating clear commitments in the principal documents in seoul to respect human rights in the region . 
greater attention must also be paid to child labour to guarantee that this practice can be eliminated as soon as possible both within asia and elsewhere . 
europe and asia must work together to intensify the battle against drug trafficking , money laundering , international crime , terrorism and the sexual exploitation of minors . 
it is very important that an agreement is struck during the next round of world trade organisation talks between our two collective regions . 
on this latter point , i would like to state that asia 's fragile economic recovery is complicated by the region 's delicate political situation . 
it is sometimes forgotten that the unprecedented period of economic growth over a quarter of a century in asia was predicated on a sustained period of political and strategic stability . 
much of this stability does not exist in the region at this time . 
the korean peninsula is a source of continuing strategic instability . 
the rebuilding of east timor is still an ongoing process . 
it is not sufficient that we only meet once every five or six years for a parliamentary dialogue between the representatives of this parliament and the representatives of india , nepal , pakistan , sri lanka , bangladesh and buta. these are just countries covered by the particular delegation that i happen to be chairman of . 
i would appeal to mrs randzio - plath , who has a strong input in the budgetary committee , to help provide the finances to enable this delegatio. and others where such a step would be meaningfu. to increase the frequency of these meetings . 
mr president , first of all i should like to tell mr nassauer that while we must regret the fact that the european union has a low profile in the countries of asia , we must also admit our own responsibility to a certain extent and acknowledge our missed opportunities . 
this report does not in fact deal with diplomacy and foreign policy but instead confines itself to tackling the question of the postgraduate training , if you will , of european diplomats , or future diplomats . 
another missed opportunity . 
on the matter of asean , we ought to ask ourselves what type of relations the european union has or ought to have with asean . 
firstly , we cannot ignore the very different concepts of integration in the european union and within asean . 
there is no political integration , not even the prospect of political integration , between the asean countries , nor should we forget , as i feel some previous speakers seem to have done , that the governments within asean are all very different : we have totalitarian or dictatorial regimes , even hardline dictatorships like china , alongside democratic countries . 
it is not , therefore , surprising that there is , in this context , no real integration or genuine political dialogue . 
the european union should perhaps look into the problem and return to good , sound bilateral relations which could be appreciably different according to whether they involved a democracy or a dictatorial or totalitarian regime . 
i also think that the optimism shown regarding the korean reunification process is somewhat excessive . 
the one swallow that you might see in the summit between the president of the korean republic and the leader of the dictatorial regime of north korea does not definitely mean that winter is over for the citizens of north korea . 
let me remind you , ladies and gentlemen , that in the course of the last five years , somewhere between two and four million people have died of starvation under this idyllic regime . 
similarly , i find it intolerable that the european union , in its dialogue with asia , should avoid the question of india , which is a democracy , with a population in the order of that of its neighbour on the other side , china , but not the same type of government , and which does not have the same special relationship with the european union . 
i therefore feel that we cannot continue to disregard this chinese monster , which is slowly changing into a communist dictatorship , a new , national communist dictatorship . 
we have had a forty - year cold war between the soviet union and the democratic world , and i think there is an urgent need to avoid wasting opportunities like these summits to lift the lid on this major problem . 
finally , mrs randzio - plath , i should like to say that if we wish to step up parliamentary cooperation , we can only do so with the democratic countries in this region , i.e. with countries that actually have parliaments . 
if there is to be any parliamentary cooperation at all , then it must be with such countries and not with the officials of the communist party of china or other countries in the region . 
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his input in this debate and for his sound plans . 
i very much back the idea of strengthening economic , cultural and political ties with asean and asem . 
i also believe in involving the ngos , mainstream society and the citizens of those countries . 
meanwhile , indonesia is dealing with a total of one million refugees internally , 130 000 of whom are in timor and 300 000 on the moluccan islands . 
especially in the moluccas , where aggressive muslim groups are spreading death and destruction , the situation is plainly disastrous . 
with more than 5 000 killed , tens of thousands wounded and more than 300 000 refugees , the large moluccan community in the netherland . 50 000 eu citizen. is worried out of its mind . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should just like to say a few words to emphasise our great concern about timor and to urge that this issue be specifically tabled on the agenda of the forthcoming summit . 
i would like to mention the situation between the people 's republic of china and taiwan . 
i believe we should make it clear that the election of the new taiwanese president is a historical opportunity to overcome the differences on the two sides of the taiwan strait , and we should do this . 
it is not acceptable that we assisted korea during the asean crisis by means of imf loans and suchlike , only for korea still to be subsidising its shipyards , which is creating unjustifiable problems for our own shipyards . 
my third point is one that affects not only us but also the countries of asia . 
as has already been mentioned , we need an interparliamentary dialogue , a dialogue between the european parliament and the parliaments of the 10 asian states . 
you quite rightly mentioned that one of the key points at the asia - europe summit will be the wide - ranging dialogue , that is to say the expression of various different interests on the part of europe and asia . 
it is not acceptable for these interests only to be the subject of exchanges between governments and officials , with academics and journalists generously being allowed to participate . 
members of parliament also need to take part in this proces. this is no longer a question of pure foreign policy . 
these are all political issues which significantly affect the situation in individual countries , and so members of parliament must be involved in this . 
when the japanese members of parliament come to see us in strasbourg in november , mr president , we will ask them to see if the next meeting between members of the european parliament and members of parliament from the asian countries can , if at all possible , be organised in japan . 
mr president , first of all , i would like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to the debate and make some brief comments . 
in the economic field , i must remind you that we have two action plans in place , one to aid commerce and the other to promote investments , both of which are very active . 
with regard to the social aspects , we proposed a new body at the tim. the social foru. which would represent civil society . 
as i pointed out earlier in my presentation , the countries of asia have not unfortunately been in favour of that proposal , which is something we regret . 
with regard to parliamentary cooperation , i would like to remind you that there have been two meetings : one in the philippines and the other in portugal , on cooperation between young parliamentarians , in which european parliamentarians have also taken part . 
we will consider any additional interparliamentary relations to be enormously positive . 
with regard to the comments on certain specific countries , i would like to point out the following : first , with regard to myanmar , it is clear that it is not a participating nation in the asem process and nor is there any intention to admit it into that process . 
this situation is discussed every time there is political dialogue , and the circumstances are clearly not conducive to moving in that direction . 
mr president , i have not had any feedback on my comments regarding the moluccan islands in indonesia , where problems are more serious than in timor at the moment . 
there are 300 000 refugees , probably 10 000 killed and tens of thousands wounded . 
surely the moluccas cannot be overlooked in the asem negotiations . 
parliament has endorsed the inclusion of intermodal terminals , whereas the council completely disagreed with this , although terminals will of course have a far more significant part to play in future european transport policy than they perhaps do at present . 
ports are in competition with each other , and that is a good thing . 
but in order to guarantee a level playing field parliament requested that we should not be promoting superstructure investments but , at most , investment in infrastructure . 
the council has so far not been able to accept this basic concern , and neither has the commission , by the way . 
so we must work together to find solutions that will ensure a level playing field in terms of infrastructure . 
one point that i welcome here is that the council has evidently accepted the modification of project no 8 . 
parliament is in agreement with this . 
however , this also means that the council has finally accepted that codecision should also apply to the 14 important essen projects . 
whatever we agree tomorrow will ultimately have to go into the conciliation procedure . 
i would specifically like to acknowledge the french presidency 's efforts to establish a common approach at this early stage . 
my speaking time is running out , mr president , and i shall finish there ; but before i do , as we are debating shipping , i too should like to express my deep - felt sorrow at the loss of life of our fellow human beings who were travelling on one of the many ships needed to serve the many greek islands , which obviously therefore require a great deal of specific interest on our part . 
this interest needs to be manifested constantly as there will always be numerous islands with natural features which we cannot change . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group , i wish to thank the rapporteur for some very thorough work with regard to this important issue . 
the purpose of the trans - european networks is to link up different regions of the eu , so that the common market may function effectively . 
the rapporteur , however , has viewed the matter mainly from the angle of large ports . 
the number of tonnes given for freight are important , but they do not always tell the whole truth . 
mr president , the european union boasts great variety , yet we have a tendency to centralise everything and make it uniform . 
this report and these amendments , in fact , deal with a number of very different situations . 
as before , when we were discussing reports on marine pollution and air traffic , we need to draw a distinction between north and south , large and small , and policy which is driven by profit and that which is driven by environmental considerations . 
it is therefore not easy to use the same yardstick to assess all ports across the european union . 
according to some , the report and its amendments enable small ports to strengthen their position , ports which are indispensable for the accessibility and survival of islands and remote coastal areas . 
based on this viewpoint , every small port and every ferry port which handles a great deal of tourist traffic should feature on the european list . 
port policy would then mainly focus on offering support to peripheral regions . 
they are caught up in a bitter competitive battle , partly brought on by the fact that they are offering as many facilities as possible to transport companies at the lowest possible rates . 
there is even a notion that rotterdam should be a " mainport " where all goods reaching the european west coast from other continents must be transhipped to vessels which distribute them to the surrounding ports . 
other large ports too are striving for growth and dominance . 
this competitive battle is at the expense of the environment and at the expense of the financial elbowroom of the large cities . 
european port policy should be able to do something about this and should be able to distribute the cargo volumes over a larger area . 
unfortunately , i have not been able to find initiatives to this effect in any of the proposals . 
mr president , the trans - european networks are intended to link the different regions of the european union , not only as a means of transport , but also as a way of sharpening the competitive edge and hence of increasing employment in certain regions . 
the emphasis is on routes between different member states . 
logically , this means that attention will be focused on projects with cross - border implications . 
the transport situations within the different member states are far from identical . 
whereas in the southern member states , road and rail are the key modes of continental transport , the more northerly countries prefer to rely mainly on water transport . 
against this background , it goes without saying that the tens mirror these modes of transport and the interaction between them . 
moreover , those modalities which cause least harm in terms of space and the environment must be included in the tens without fail . 
very often , seaports are the first and last ports of call for cargo in europe . 
that cannot be in our interest . 
investment in the trans - european network only makes sense if we create genuine networks covering wide areas and bringing advantages for the public throughout the european union . 
a forward - looking maritime strategy should not be exclusive , it should be inclusive . 
i therefore ask the rapporteur and the others who have spoken to give this their learned support . 
mr president , i would like to thank mr piecyk for his work . 
the issue of inland ports and intermodal terminals is very complex and i would like to stress that a broad consensus has been achieved . 
we all agree that the trans - european network must be a multimodal network . 
we also believe that we all agree that it must include the main points of connection , and that we consider that the current provisions of the trans - european networks on ports are not satisfactory and that strengthening the role of ports within the network will also serve to consolidate the trans - european networks . 
i believe that parliament and the commission broadly agree on most of the areas under discussion . 
we agree that the inclusion of too many ports in the network may affect this concept of ' trans - european ' and that , therefore , the most strategically important inland ports should be included . 
we support the aim of the amendments but , nevertheless , we cannot support their wording . 
on the one hand , because we believe it is inappropriate to talk about the funding of these guidelines and , secondly , because we do not believe it is necessary to make this reference . 
it is the case that the types of project which parliament is referring to when it talks of superstructures are not included in the projects of common interest and do not therefore have funding . 
this is therefore , to a certain extent , an unnecessary debate . 
more capacity makes transport more efficient in the operational sphere , and this means that both transport company and consumer stand to gain from this . 
longer buses also make a more efficient use of roads possible and this means that the environment benefits . 
in our opinion , this constitutes an infringement of the freedom of the manufacturer who must be able to decide , in consultation with the customer , how many axles are required to meet the safety standards and demands in terms of weight , because by no means do all buses and coaches carry the same load ; think of vip coaches , for example . 
this means , in practice , that the running costs must not be compromised unnecessarily by fitting a third axle , which is not necessary , strictly speaking . 
as many seemed in agreement with this during the committee meeting , i have , on behalf of my group , re - tabled the amendment to this effect . 
if we consider for a moment the subject of longer buses and the environment , then a situation can arise , as depicted by mrs sanders - ten holte , of cheaper and more efficient transport where small businesses may have greater earnings in this field and make more profit . 
however , prices drop which inevitably means that buses are used as an extremely cheap mode of transport , as is very much in evidence at the moment . 
in other words , i can condone the lengthening of buses based on environmental and other considerations , but there are also a number of side - effects which are being overlooked , in fact , by this directive and which cannot be dealt with here either , but to which we would like draw attention . 
giving industry some space to catch up seems justified in my opinion . 
three axles , as mrs sanders - ten holte indicated , are not always necessary , but what is necessary is to draft a sound directive . 
mr president , commissioner , firstly credit must go to mr hatzidakis for his proactive approach in his report . 
european bus measurements may seem a trivial matter , but it is no such thing . 
our objective of a dynamic single market can only come about if all players comply with the same regulations . 
competition , which is a prime mover in the arena of real development , will begin when transport companies can offer cross - border services . 
there are no greek bus companies in our country , finland , but the scots have already got a firm foothold . 
stinginess pays off . 
in order to continue the positive spread of competition we must harmonise bus standards . 
uniform measurements will also mean cost saving for manufacturers , which will be reflected in fares and the pockets of eu citizens . 
the rapporteur , mr hatzidakis , is right that it would be unfair to call for the transition period with regard to buses already in operation in domestic traffic to end by 2009 . 
people will not feel favourably disposed towards the eu if we start scrapping buses that are still in perfectly good condition , before their time . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
are there any comments ? 
( the minutes were approved ) 
madam president , yesterday we decide. and this is also recorded in the minute. to hold a debate on thursday on developments in the middle east . 
however , we did not set a deadline for tabling motions for resolutions . 
i would request that we set such a deadline , both for the actual motion. this could be today at 6 p.m. and for amendments , where we should try to set the deadline for as late as possible tomorrow , so that we can take into account any results from the meeting between ehud barak and yassir arafat tomorrow in paris . 
i would ask that we set this deadline and that it be as late as possible . 
the group of the party of european socialists has requested that the debate on the situation regarding the middle east peace process , that was timetabled for thursday afternoon , be closed with a motion for a resolution . 
i will now put this request to the vote . 
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , mr president of the commission , i am with you completely , mr prodi , when you highlight the limitations of the current intergovernmental model , and i would go even further in my criticism than you . 
it is my belief that if we are to succeed we need a participatory democracy , social advances , bonds of solidarity , designs for civilisation and ethical inspiration . 
i have heard no mention of these this morning . 
in short , we need politics in the true sense of the word , since it is on this that the future of europe hinges . 
madam president , the decision of the danish people on 28 september on participation in the european currency regime will undoubtedly figure at the biarritz european council meeting . 
eu member state governments must now seriously reflect on what has happened in denmark . 
the danish decision comes two months before eu leaders are to meet in nice to reform existing eu treaties and policies . 
i support the enlargement of the european union . 
it will help consolidate democratic and civil structures in eastern and central europe , expand market economies and help build a european continent at peace with itself . 
however , eu member state governments face difficult choices . 
we cannot deny that the danish people used the recent referendum as a test of confidence in the structures of the european union . 
that is what the charter stipulates . 
let us not violate it before it is even applied . 
this right to difference and to respect is what must underpin any debate on institutional affairs , particularly at biarritz . 
this is vital if we are to stop europe drifting off course as it is now , seeking an identity somewhere between harmonisation and standardisation , which europeans , quite justifiably , find so difficult to accept . 
unfortunately , this would seem to be the path that the intergovernmental conference wants to follow , by focusing on the extension of qualified majority voting . 
the environment , for example , will not be protected more efficiently as a result of our wanting to impose a policy that ignores economic realities and peoples ' needs . 
let us therefore take advantage of the current discussions within the igc to redefine , at last , a system that has reached its limits . 
the current desire to extend qualified majority voting will not bring europe closer to the citizens . 
on the contrary , it will leave those who do not accept the single mindset by the wayside . 
just how many different speeds will there be in the europe towards which you want to lead us ? 
here are just a few of the many avenues which could be explored . 
we need , for example , to agree to and facilitate subsidiarity . 
europe must limit its responsibilities to those that the states cannot effectively assume alone . 
previous speakers have spoken well of the charter because it is a good charter which brings together the classic rights of the nineteenth century and the modern rights of the twenty - first century . 
it is a charter for the citizens , who have participated actively in its creation . 
as far as biarritz is concerned , i should like to point out that it is not far from there to nice , but neithe. more importantl. is it very long now . 
the question of whether the member states will be able to agree on a new treaty in nice is still completely open . 
the attitude of the french presidenc. that they would rather have no treaty at all than a bad on. is sensible in my opinion . 
however , people 's views on what makes a good or bad treaty are still miles apart . 
in addition , the french presidency is not escaping criticism from leading european diplomats because of the way in which it is conducting the negotiations . 
the first has been the method selected , that of the convention , which took the form of a judicious blend involving the competent representatives at national and european level , even if there was an extra guest at the table , as commissioner vitorino underlined . 
the french presidency therefore has a big responsibility for ensuring that genuine and tangible results are achieved in nice , and the new treaty must really create a european union for new member states . 
the institutional issues need to be solved and a clear mandate provided for continued work on a european constitution which is citizen - friendly and comprehensible . 
the charter must be incorporated into this constitution , and i hope that a signal to this effect will be given in biarritz . 
for us liberals , it is an obvious fact , and one that needs to be crystal - clear , that the present intergovernmental conference must be the last before new member states are admitted . 
unsolved issues about the future of the european project may not be used as justification for further postponing our historic task to unite europe . 
the eu will never be ready , but the candidate countries must participate actively in future discussions . 
the convention method is perhaps more suitable than these intergovernmental conferences we have had in the past . 
expectations prior to the meeting in biarritz are running high . 
i would just like to focus briefly on the appraisal of the convention method . 
it is quite true that it is an improvement on an intergovernmental conference , bu. take note , ladies and gentleme. even the convention was forced to achieve consensus on every single word and , in the end , particularly during the concluding phase , it turned into a sort of intergovernmental conference ii : our praesidium had to negotiate with the member states instead of , or as well as , members of parliament . 
i therefore feel that , once again , the obligation to achieve unanimity on every single part of the charter as well as on the final result will prove extremely hampering when we come to evaluate the content of the charter itself . 
mr president , mr prodi has referred to the referendum in denmark , the outcome of which i believe reflects a malaise that extends far beyond that country . 
many european citizens are questioning the point reached by the union , its objectives and even the logic of integration . 
we say that there is a crisis of confidence with regard to the institutions , and i feel that this crisis is due in particular to the disparity between the expectations of society and the ability to live up to them . 
while growth continues apace , inequalities have become increasingly intolerable . 
we know that things are not going well and it is better to admit it openly . 
and so , president , you who bear the greater responsibility , forge ahead right to the very end. you are committed , as are we , to absolute coherence , but there are two things which have to be done : firstly , you must make it clear immediately that , if nice is a failure , there will be an internal crisis which may well involve resignations from the commission , if necessary , and secondly , you must make it just as clear that enlargement is impossible without prior thorough reform . 
europe is in danger of being defeated by compromises , not crises . 
when such crises are triggered by opposing views they are healthy . 
mr president , like all top class cyclists , president prodi knows the right moment to break away from the pack . 
this is what he has done this morning in this speech which has given us all fresh hope . 
i would like to focus on two facts which produce opposing reactions : satisfaction at the convention and bitterness at the outcome of the referendum in denmark . 
these are two different results which , however , i feel are closely related and herald new times . 
almost 90 % of the population took part in the danish referendum , a level which bears unequivocal witness to the citizens ' interest in contributing to european decision - making . 
on the other hand , the result , which we fully respect , may be an indication that the citizens do not yet feel in tune with the european ideal . 
the problem may well be a general one . 
it must be admitted that , after 55 years of community life , there may well be a lack of feeling of belonging to anything other than a merely geographical europe . 
the internal borders of today and the single currency of tomorrow are certainly useful , necessary symbols which will affect citizens ' everyday lives in a practical way and contribute to reinforcing the european ideal , but they will not fulfil the citizens ' call for greater heed to be paid to their views and for greater representation of their interests and , above all , of their hopes for the future . 
this was the cologne mandate and this is also what the charter can do , whether it becomes binding or not . 
the charter should become a live instrument , both legally and politically . 
on a legal plane , i can think of forms of enforcement other than direct enforcement by the european court on an individual basis . 
for example , in the council of europe and the ilo , there is a wealth of experience in terms of reporting procedures , expert committees and the collective right of complaint of trade unions and ngos , and it is through these means that the charter can be monitored from a legal perspective . 
therefore , this last prospect should certainly not be restricted by pre - set limits but rather , while remaining within the bounds of an accepted legal and institutional framework , enable the member states who are ready to do so to set off along the path of deeper political integration , leaving the way open for the others to join them when they consider the time is right . 
we must allow everyone to follow his own political project in the union , in a harmony of differences which , after all , has already proved to be a winning solution in the history of the european union . 
mr president , like many in the house i very much welcomed what mr prodi said to us this morning , both about the architecture of the union and its institutions and about the charter of rights . 
i am one of those who believe that adopting the charter , even in a declaratory mode , will be a welcome step forward because it will certainly lead in due course to a charter that is fully legally binding . 
i should like to draw the attention of the house and the commission to the question which will arise this friday when we are discussing the rights of the lettori , the foreign language lecturers in italian universities . 
here we have a situation where rights possessed by citizens of the union have been denied for twelve years and more . 
it is no good agreeing a charter of rights at the highest level if individual citizens who are wronged by a state have no effective remedy . 
we insist , therefore , that as well as the commitment to the charter we have heard from the commission today , it also commits itself to protecting the rights of individual citizens . 
mr president , the proposed charter of fundamental rights does not mean that citizens ' rights are to be reinforced . 
this is also clear from article 50 of the treaty . 
this would also reinforce pan - european cooperation in this sphere instead of weakening it , as there is a danger of the eu charter doing . 
mr president , the result of the danish referendum ought to be understood free from false interpretations . 
the danish ' no ' vote is not isolationist or nationalistic in character . 
it is not a sign that a majority of danes are saying ' no ' to european cooperation or that the danes are not carefully informed about the ins and outs and development plans of the european union . 
a majority of danes have said ' no ' , as they did in 1992 and 1993, to more european integration , ' no ' to surrendering more sovereignty and ' no ' to the tools which serve these purposes , that is to say the euro , majority decision - making and a european constitution . 
it should not be imagined that the european project , of which we have heard the president of the commission , mr prodi give such a clear description , could have convinced the danes and persuaded them to vote ' yes ' . 
however , what the summit can do is to prepare the groundwork for nice , and this is why this debate is certainly useful to get across our parliamentary message . 
with regard to biarritz , i desperately hope that the amsterdam leftovers can be resolved very quickly . 
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , rarely can a presidency of the european union have been so burdened with challenges and chock - full of events . 
these challenges are , in essence , the intergovernmental conference and the preparation for enlargement , which are of course interconnected . 
the events are the problems currently being experienced by the euro , the surge in oil prices and , on a different level , the hopes for a transition towards democracy in yugoslavia . 
in other words , the french presidency 's task is no easy one . 
we , as elected representatives , are at least as responsible for encouraging it to make progress in the face of adversity as we are for relaying the messages that we receive from public opinion in each of our countries . 
despite the demands made here today in this house , it would appear that the charter is not going to be made legally binding , but is merely to be a political declaration . 
i use the word ' merely ' , although i believe that , despite its declaratory nature , the ec court will have to apply the articles of the charter in their judicial practices as self - binding principles , with which the interpretation of the court must naturally be in harmony . 
in this way they will gradually become de facto legally binding legal norms . 
the charter is an indication that the union bears a responsibility for and cares about human rights . 
for the implementation of human rights to be monitored in practice also , however , the union must have clear rules regarding possible sanction mechanisms to be used against member states . 
at present , the council is talking about incorporating such mechanisms in article 7 . 
an agreement on procedures in itself is a good thing , but we must make sure that the system cannot be used as a political weapon . 
according to ancient finnish wisdom , you should examine a person first before hitting him . 
at present i feel there is a danger that if the proposal by the belgian government on these sanction mechanisms were to be implemented , we would be hitting first and examining only afterwards . 
mr president , mr president of the commission , mr president - in - office , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank the european parliament delegation in the convention and the president of the convention , mr roman herzog , for their committed work . 
the drafting of a european charter of fundamental rights is an important and necessary step towards a europe which is close to the people . 
some people think that it is possible to create an internal market in europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles . 
the majority of the european parliament has never supported this view . 
secondly , it lies in its transparency for the public , who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply european law , and in its transparency for those who do precisely that , draft or apply european law . 
mr president , we have just had a debate that was both interesting and productive . 
i have of course note. and this is cause for great satisfactio. that the european parliament is almost unanimously content with the charter . 
this is not surprising because it has itself contributed to it , and because it is consonant with some of its values . 
that lends great weight to this text , and to the european council as concerns furthering the charter . 
i have noted your appeals and invitations to press ahead , to take advantage of the momentum generated and carry it to nice and beyond . 
on this issue i would like to indicate , if not my disagreement , then at least some slight differences in opinion on two points . 
the first concerns the common foreign and security policy , and the suggestion to integrate the high representative for cfsp into the commission . 
you will be aware that this was a deliberate decision taken in amsterdam to clearly distinguish the two roles , with the high representative , as opposed to the commission , not speaking from a completely independent viewpoint , but under a remit to coordinate the common foreign and security policies that lie within the competence of the member states , and there we should leave perhaps ample scope for an intergovernmental approach . 
cfsp , for reasons as much to do with history as with the nature of this area , will doubtless be the subject of coordination between member states for some time to come . 
perhaps one day we will have to abolish this function , but that day has not yet come . 
it is time , instead , to intensify this function . 
the second slight difference concerns the euro . 
the recent fluctuations in this currency have revealed the need for a more political style of governance , of management . 
for all that , we should not , i feel , steer clear of strong intergovernmental cooperation , cooperation in respect of economic policies , when seeking solutions . 
as for the future , perhaps the method will indeed have to be reviewed , to comprise , perhaps , a convention rather than an igc , even if it should perhaps not become a system . 
mr lannoye welcomed the view that i expressed with regard to a european constitution . 
i do not know whether , as one of the speakers said , i am representative of my institution , and must say that this is my own personal opinion . 
i could mention , for example , the social agenda which is a priority for us , or the setting in place of something that i would not call an economic government , but economic governance , to address these problems . 
i will end by saying let there be no doubt but that the french presidency intends to give the european parliament all the attention it deserves , and that i will be in this chamber on 24 october to report on biarritz . 
it reads thus : ' parliament proposes , in line with the position it expounded when the convention began its work , that , at its meeting in biarritz , the european council call on the intergovernmental conference to consider the text of the charter adopted by the convention and ways of incorporating it into the treaty with a view to a decision being taken at the european council meeting in nice ' . 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
bodrato recommendations ( a5 - 0263 and 0262 / 2000 ) 
. the draft regulations of the un / ece for approval of motor vehicle headlamps and other special equipment is only significant in terms of parliament 's participation in the drafting of community legislation on harmonising motor vehicle standards throughout europe . 
these standards are drawn up on the basis of the revised agreement of the united nations economic commission for europe ( un / ece ) of which the community became a contracting party in march 1988 . 
consequently proposals are submitted to parliament under the assent procedure , meaning that parliament can no longer table amendments , as directives in this area were adopted as single market legislation under the codecision procedure on the basis of art.100a tec . 
indeed , the reports of the european court of auditors continually comment on understating of this type , from greece to portugal . 
in the case in point , the amendment of the 1996 council regulation before us , the commission proposes to register taxes and contributions by taking account primarily of the revenue actually collected , rather than the tax calculated as due on the basis of the taxable event . 
the commission also proposes to apply a coefficient to the ' non collectable ' percentage in order to avoid understating the true level of deficit , compared with the maastricht requirements . 
while it all seems purely to do with technical matters , there are nonetheless considerable political implications . 
piecyk recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0232 / 2000 ) 
mr president , before i left for strasbourg to come to this part - session , a pensioner from cremona , a town in the po valley on the river po , asked me to tell him when it would at last be possible to sail on the po . 
in order to do something to meet the expectations of this pensioner , who is called giuseppe italia , lives in cremona and would love to be able to sail on the po , i voted for the piecyk report , which concerns the expansion and development of sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals . 
i feel that it is extremely important for us to decide to develop inland shipping networks , for it would greatly reduce the intensity of heavy goods traffic travelling on roads and motorways and the damage it causes . 
hatzidakis report ( a5 - 0231 / 2000 ) 
the buses can pose a risk to cyclists and pedestrians in low - traffic urban areas and on windy country roads . 
moreover , without a compulsory second rear axle , they can destroy roads on soft soil , such as the dutch peat polders . 
it is therefore entirely justifiable that a number of eu member states only permit buses up to 12 metres . 
that is the main reason why i intend to reject the proposals . 
skinner report ( a5 - 0235 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i believ. and this also emerged clearly from the way in which people vote. that this is primarily about the fact that having losses recognised for tax purposes is a fundamental prerequisite , especially for small companies , because they risk a great deal of private capital . 
to risk personal capital , in particular , is a highly precarious business . 
that is why a facility to carry forward losses and enter them in the accounts would have a significant impact . 
mr president , i voted for the skinner report , as i explained during the debate before the vote , because i feel that risk capital is important . 
however , i would like to describe it as hope capital : it does not seem appropriate to describe as risk capital a financial initiative which is intended to improve the fate of pensioners and elderly people by making their pensions more secure . 
let us call it hope capital instead , as i proposed to mrs kauppi , who agreed with me . 
i hope that , in the future , we will also be able to change the name of this financial initiative for the investment of pension funds intended to benefit not only the elderly , but also small and medium - sized enterprises as well . 
. i welcome this excellent report from my colleague mr skinner . 
at lisbon the special european council stated that " efficient risk capital markets play a major role in innovative high growth smes and the creation of new and sustainable jobs " . 
but it has to be said that this charter is a step in the right direction . 
the achievement of the colleagues whom i named just now and others has been outstanding here . 
mr president , at last we have a charter of the rights of the european citizen with an entire articl . article 2. dedicated to the elderly . 
if , as i hope , this article becomes part of the treaty of nice , the elderly will at last be protected by a constitutional charter of fundamental rights . 
i know that many of the representatives of the committee which prepared the charter contributed to this success . 
i would like , in particular , to thank mrs van den burg , a dutch social democrat who , together with others , worked particularly hard on article 25 . 
we believe that , as a political document , the charter is a good point of departure for this wholly necessary dialogue , which is now about to begin . 
we do not , however , believe that the latter can be concluded in nice in less than three months , for which reason alone we cannot vote in favour of incorporating the charter into the treaty at the nice summit . 
the csu 's europe group welcomes the tabling of the final draft of the charter of fundamental rights because it summarises and makes visible the fundamental rights which the public are entitled to in respect of the institutions and bodies of the eu . 
however , we can only agree to the charter being incorporated into eu or community law if the eu 's powers are first clearly described and delimited . 
the charter aims to provide comprehensive protection of people 's fundamental rights and different sections go completely or partly beyond the jurisdiction of the eu . 
we reject the fundamental rights included in the charter which are appropriate but which do not justify granting the eu corresponding powers or conferring on it a duty to protect or act . 
the csu 's europe group supports the horizontal provision which makes it clear that no new powers are being established for the community or the union . 
in some parts of the charter additional significant shortcomings are to be found , which ought to be remedied before the charter is proclaimed : 
· the charter should not be overloaded with detailed rules ; these should remain the preserve of subordinate law . 
. ( fr ) a convention , made up of 62 delegates from the governments of the fifteen member states and members of european and national parliaments draws up a charter of fundamental rights for over 380 million europeans . 
this charter lags some way behind the european convention on human rights , and behind national conventions or treaties . 
it is an accurate reflection of the liberal europe which is being built . 
because social rights are fundamental rights for a europe that respects democratic and social rights and freedoms , we champion the idea of another charter to protect workers , women , foreigners , those excluded from society , national minorities . 
this charter should be drawn up by the social movement , not by an inner sanctum of elected representatives . 
because we think that the process of european integration warrants a genuine democratic public debate , there can be no political construction of europe without social rights or democracy . 
this is why i did not vote in favour of this draft charter . 
i shall be voting for an alternative charter by participating in the demonstrations in biarritz on 13 and 14 october and in nice on 7 december 2000 . 
. ( it ) we are aware that the process of institutionalising the union also requires definition of the concept of european citizenship and the institution of common values such as freedom , governability and stability . 
we would like to believe that the charter of fundamental rights is genuinely intended to strengthen the competences of the union and not those of the member states , as the convention stated when starting its work . 
yet we are somewhat perplexed by the combined effect which would be produced by the charter having binding authority over the community countries , as the european parliament requested on 26 march of this year , and the as yet incomplete and inorganic content of even the last draft presented , despite the commendable amount of work put in . 
a striking example is workers ' rights . 
a further area of confusion is the potential overlap of legal systems implemented by the supranational courts : the european communities ' legal system and the human rights system , although the latter derives from a convention which does not make sufficient provision for social and economic rights . 
in other words , we would not like the pursuance of a noble , if unsolicited goal to serve , in the medium - to - long term , not to consolidate and expand those rights which the national constitutional charters and practices fully guarantee at present , but to undermine them . 
pending further clarification , we therefore abstain from the vote . 
next there is the matter of the transitional periods . this is obviously related to the previous issue . 
as you know , the candidates have expressed a number of requests to this effect . 
this , moreover , is a sign that the accession negotiations have clearly entered a new phase and that henceforth , as the french presidency wishes , we should go into substantive discussions . 
in this respect , i should like to point out that the council has , on the basis of an initial document from the commission , initiated a consultation process which should enable the european union to make progress in the negotiations . 
finally , of course , there are the negotiating positions , concerning the most difficult chapters of the acquis , taking particular account of their budgetary implications for the european union . 
i am , of course , thinking of the common agricultural policy and the regional development policies . 
i have said , and i have no problem saying it again here today , that the french presidency will not duck any of the problems that are raised . this does not , of course , mean that we shall have the time and resources to deal with each of them . 
as far as we are concerned , however , imparting a new dynamic to these negotiations means , particularly with regard to the issue of transitional periods , we shall do all we possibly can in order to make progress pragmatically . 
next , let me say a few works on the ' helsinki six ' , in inverted commas once again , who entered into negotiations at the beginning of this year . 
obviously the work carried out by each of the rapporteurs and by the parliamentary committees will serve a useful purpose in providing fuel for our own discussions . 
let me now mention the second guideline along which the presidency hopes the enlargement process will develop in these six months . 
i have just mentioned the very important technical work under way for three years now and i have also said that , with regard to at least some candidate countries , we shall very shortly have a quite precise overview of the remaining problems . 
we think the time has come to take this work to a more political level by combining all the information available to us . 
i share your view , mr president : the european union must not have a mean - spirited attitude or a narrow - minded mentality with regard to enlargement . 
enlargement is a historic undertaking . 
enlargement is a wide - ranging goal which we must approach with a great deal of generosity and with vision . 
mr president , president - in - office , commissioner , i am extremely pleased both with the tone of this debate today and with the level of consensus that is emerging among the key groups in the house , a consensus which my group subscribes to . 
the challenge of reunification , even more perhaps than that of enlargement is so great that it suffuses and surrounds every debate in this house : this is why there is such depth and intensity to all our debates , including this morning 's debate on our own need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge . 
to create a common space of freedom , security and of values by free choice is something without a parallel among democracies in all of our history . 
it is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention . 
when we look at eurobarometer statistics , we see that 60 % or so of those who expressed a view say enlargement is not a priority , while only 27 % say it is a priority . 
moreover , the statistics are getting worse , not better . 
in the largest state of the union , the federal republic of germany , only 20 % say enlargement is a priority . 
we as politicians must take possession of this debate and not simply leave it to the bureaucracies , for though it is indispensable to discuss the details of the acquis , this is not sufficient to engage the public . 
we need a dialogue of politicians and therefore we need to avail ourselves of all the information possibilities that commissioner verheugen spoke of in his very reflective and elegant speech today . 
we need , as mr hänsch has said , to provide ourselves with information about the cost of non - enlargement , not simply in terms of finance and budget , but of security as well as , of course , socio - economic measures . 
it was franklin delano roosevelt , the american president , who once said that we have nothing to fear but fear itself . 
much of our debate about fears about enlargement is based on exaggeration , but in order to confront the populists who exaggerate , we must connect with popular politics through reflection . 
we need the commission 's help here , because even though we have the will , we sometimes lack the ammunition . 
in respect of the principles involved , we of course support differentiation ; of course , we support the principle of equality that there should not be a europe of different classes of citizenship . 
my group has 23 visiting mps , our " virtual meps " , sitting in the gallery now : i welcome all of you to this debate in the house . 
finally , the critical thing now is to move to substantive negotiation , and we are making that important step . 
the critical thing is not to allow frustration to grow among the candidate. that they are always in the anteroom but never quite in the chamber . 
that is what we must accomplish in this debate , that is the result we must pursue . 
people joke that after the collapse of the berlin wall enlargement is always just five years away . 
we must show they are wrong . 
let us take the first step in that direction during this mandate . 
it is true that in talks with the countries involved in the first stage , which have lasted two years , we have not yet got around to dealing with the most difficult issues and we have not yet seriously managed to discuss agricultural policy , structural funds or issues of freedom of movement . 
we also have to take this criticism seriously . 
our group requires target dates to be set at the nice summit or immediately afterwards , by which negotiations on membership should be concluded . 
this is vital for us , the european union , in order for us to be able to set targets for ourselves with regard to completing our own internal reforms . 
commissioner verheugen mentioned corruption , but i would like to mention the fact that we cannot infect future member states with bad administrative practice either . 
we must also take our own administrative reforms very seriously if we also wish to root out corruption in future member states , as transparency and good administration are the best guarantee that there is no corruption . 
secondly the target dates are necessary because we must boost the efforts of the applicant countries in their quest for membership . 
our group believes that it is quite possible , if we are so determined , to include the first group of applicant countries already in the next european parliamentary elections , if there is determination on both sides to do so . 
each country must obviously be appraised on its own merits individually . 
the next natural opportunity would be the european parliamentary elections that follow in 2009, but we would like to push for as many countries as possible joining in 2004 . 
we support the commission in its quest for a realistic , serious and honest debate on the political questions of enlargement . 
commissioner verheugen , you may rely on the support of our group when you say you want to find real political answers to real political questions . 
it is gratifying to hear your policy in this matter . 
finally , i would like to speak about financing . 
our group does not entirely believe that the present level of financing agreed in the financial framework is sufficient , and so we are prepared to discuss any amendment to the financial perspectives . 
one quite simple way to proceed would b. as funds have been set aside anyway for five new member states after 2002, if they happen to join the unio. to use these funds in future for this support preceding membership . 
above all we need commitment and that is what the european parliament , for its part , must demonstrate in this debate and when taking decisions . 
however , we disagree on some important issues . 
our support for enlargement goes without saying . 
we are also in favour of a european union that includes russia , and which therefore includes all the countries which have buil. albeit in conflicting way. this historical , cultural , economic , social and political reality known as europe . 
the only condition would b. in our vie. that they share our democratic values and respect for human rights and the rule of law . 
we do not agree with recital a where it says that europe was divided by the soviet occupation because , as everybody knows and as any history book will tell you , the division was a consequence of the yalta conference and the intransigence of truman who was determined to follow a policy of confrontation . 
furthermore , there are six basic aspects which worry us because of the method employed . 
firstly , we are against the ' regatta principle ' , which seems more like an entrance examination which every teacher puts their pupil through when it would have been better for the pupil to sit the exam in stages and to a previously established timetable , which would have aided the rapprochement of the two societies , thereby preventing the adverse consequences we are now seeing . 
secondly , given the reality that the neo - liberal economic model established in maastricht leads to the paradox of growth with more inequalities , the most likely outcome of the incorporation of these countries is greater unemployment and inequality , as is already happening . 
it is just that , as things stand , i cannot guarantee that they will be ready . 
thank you very much for that clarification , commissioner . 
the various rapporteurs will now speak . 
mrs carlsson has the floor first . 
mr president , today when i flew from stockholm , in over germany and then drove on down to historic alsace , i could not help but feel grateful for this europe of mine . 
i was born at a time when , and in a place where , there has been no direct reason for thinking of war and calamity . 
before i was born , freedom and democracy had triumphed over oppression and the insanity of war , and a european union was being formed . 
there have been strains but , on the whole , peace and trade have established a closer association between people , now further consolidated by means of the currency union . 
few people believed that it was possible to reunify germany . 
everyone was surprised by the dynamism of that process , which was so skilfully handled by chancellor kohl . 
in that case , it will , in my view , have failed in its mission and purpose . 
the baltic states are small coastal states bordering on a powerful neighbour . 
they possess a rich source of culture , diversity and potential which the united europe cannot do without . 
each one of the countries is to be judged on the basis of its own merits . they are not to be judged en masse or on the basis of some special geopolitical position they might occupy . 
it must be the results of the negotiations which count . 
enlargement ought not to be postponed because of the need to keep to timetables . 
as may be seen from the report , i am enthusiastic about what a country can achieve in the course of ten years of reform work . 
i am impressed by the political consensus that exists and by the leadership exercised by prime minister mart laar . 
as i see it , the enlargement process ought not to be dragged out unnecessarily . 
it is now that we are in a position to secure common values and benefits . 
as a conservative , i am incredibly thrifty with taxpayers ' money . 
i should like to express my gratitude for the good will with which my report was received by the committee . 
the only amendment which has already been tabled is covered in my report , but i am pleased that the greens wish to emphasise the importance of treating citizens equally . 
mr president , mr president - in - office , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we consider the progress made by latvia since independence to be a real success story . 
in 1991, latvia was still a province of the soviet union ; since then it has built up a basic democratic order and its own state , introduced a market economy and created new ownership rights , to mention just a few points . 
imagine if such radical economic and social change had taken place in your own country in such a short space of time . 
only then , i think , can you have any notion of what the people of latvia have achieved over recent years . 
in this context , it would be positively humiliating if the european union failed to get started on the reforms needed in order to be able to receive the central and eastern european countries , malta and cyprus ; and those who continue to apply the brakes here are merely demonstrating that they are much less capable of reform than any of the candidate countries , especially little latvia . 
the critical comments and the proposals in my report for urgently needed progress in administrative and social reform are designed to bring latvia quickly and successfully into the european union . 
in the present circumstances , one thing is clear : the key to this is to be found in a transparent administration at all levels . 
this does not just mean a law for the civil service ; it also means giving young civil servants opportunities and paying them a decent wage . 
it is still hot air , mr verheugen ; the actual agencies responsible for the project have not even noticed it exists . 
it is not enough ; the whole strategy needs to be geared more to the citizens . 
it is of paramount importance for the candidate countries to be more involved in the area of employment policy . 
the process of economic change and fast transition has not only brought successes ; it has also resulted in social differences , increasing regional disparities and huge hidden unemployment , which is why these issues must take priority in the pre - accession strategy . 
i see an urgent need to focus more on structural measures here and not to postpone implementing freedom of movement as a response to unemployment in latvia . 
it is our job to continue to support latvia with the integration of the russian population . 
this month , on 8 october , lithuania will be holding parliamentary elections . 
lithuania is on its way to joining the world trade organisation . 
lithuania has considerable potential for long - term economic growth . 
the international monetary fund has forecast growth of 2.1 % in the gross domestic product this year . 
there is a good chance of this , but particular efforts are still needed . 
policy still needs to concentrate on creating the right conditions for innovation and modernisation in key sectors of the economy . 
the fact that the lithuanian currency is still pegged to the dollar is also important here , because as the dollar rises , so too does the value of the litas against the euro . 
as a result , revenue from exports from lithuania to the euro zone is down and , similarly , producers are of course facing stiffer competition on the domestic market from exporters in the euro zone . 
there are plans to peg the litas to the euro in the second half of 2001 . 
as i said , despite a number of shortcomings and weaknesses , lithuania has made good progress in the economic area and is only a short way away from a working market economic . 
as far as the ignalina nuclear power station is concerned , there is no doubt that the two chernobyl - type reactors need to be decommissioned . 
lithuania voted an energy strategy through parliament at the end of 1999 and , in may of this year , the seimas passed a law to decommission unit 1 in 2004 . 
a decision on the decommissioning of unit 2 will then be taken in 2004 . 
i am most grateful to commissioner verheugen for clarifying the question of the closure of nuclear power plants . 
it is an important point here too . 
now to kaliningrad . 
this issue requires a special effort and , in my view , cannot be dealt with purely as a problem on the fringe of the issue of the accession of lithuania and poland . 
the law on the use of minority languages is a large step in the right direction but the technical implementation of this act has been inadequate . 
the problems that do remain are not therefore related to the exercising or safeguarding of civil or political rights but involve fighting more effectively against some less positive aspects . 
in this context , the issue of integrating the ethnic gypsy minority into hungarian society has been central to the discussions held in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy . 
thirdly , with regard to agriculture , which has a lower level of productivity than in the european union , we need to ensure that the agricultural market is fully opened up to the capital that is necessary for land privatisation , for the modernisation of farms and marketing structures and for improving yields . 
the prohibition on non - hungarian citizens buying farmland is , however , an obstacle to setting a fair price for this land . 
fourthly , there is the topical issue of the fight against organised crime , specifically crime that has its roots in russia . 
the high level of crime and the considerable implications of this type of crime are perhaps hungary 's most serious domestic issue , despite the fact that the hungarian parliament has already voted in favour of a raft of measures on money - laundering , on longer sentences for drug - trafficking and prostitution , on confiscating funds and on a witness - protection programme for informers . 
-- mr president , romania 's people welcome wholeheartedly the european union 's helsinki decision to incorporate romania in the first wave of the current enlargement countries . 
indeed , 80 % of romania 's people believe that romania belongs in the european union . 
perhaps it is no coincidence that those same public polls show that the european union ambassador is the second most popular person in romania today . 
since last december , therefore , there have been many encouraging signs . 
acute poverty has been a key problem in romania since 1990 and under the present government , the economy is at last showing real signs of improvement . 
this will ensure greater stability , improve the climate for bilateral relations and provide all the peoples concerned with enhanced opportunities for economic development . 
mr president , the report on the accession of cyprus , which i am honoured to present to you , in comparison with the series of reports which you have heard about this afternoon , includes a special political aspect . 
this is a candidate country where a third of the territory has since 1974 been occupied by the turkish army and where , because of a particularly impervious line of demarcation , the fundamental principles of the european union cannot be applied across all of the territory . 
the report which it is my honour to submit , which was also unanimously adopted in committee , observes that the part of the territory controlled by the legal authority fulfils the copenhagen political criteria . 
cyprus has a viable and prosperous market economy and should not encounter any particular problems in adopting the acquis communautaire . 
i have a duty to point out , however , that transposing the acquis communautaire is taking too long and that cyprus , like other candidate countries moreover , should tighten up its administrative , fiscal and legal systems . 
i am convinced that cyprus ' accession could serve as a catalyst and a driving force in finding a solution to the political problem of the division of the island . 
perpetuation of the status quo following the turkish invasion of july - august 1974 is not acceptable to the european union . 
we therefore support the proximity talks which are currently being conducted under the auspices of the united nations . 
we must however also point out that the definitive solution , a fair and lasting solution , must fully comply with both the relevant united nations security council resolutions , with this being , quite simply , the international law in force , and also the principles governing the european union . 
i am thinking , of course , primarily of the political principles , but also the principles of freedom of movement and of establishment . 
now that both cyprus and turkey are candidate countries , the cyprus conflict ceases to be peripheral to europe but rather an internal community conflict . 
we must therefore have recourse to every means possible and to every asset available to us . 
you might say that i represent a region which , ten years ago , represented a good part of enlargement to the eas . i too lived on the other side of the iron curtain . 
allow me also to say at this point that i have a great deal of respect for the citizens of the central and eastern european countries who , ten years ago , had the courage to go into the streets and start this process . 
they deserve my thanks , as of course do the member states of the european union at the time and the commission and parliament , for the solidarity which they have always demonstrated with our regions . 
secondly : there must be guaranteed improvements to and simplification of the legal framework for market access and financing . 
stability fosters economic success . 
however much some people wish it did , diversifying out of atomic energy does not form part of the community acquis . 
hence , if we are to be honest , we cannot keep setting up new hurdles in these areas . 
the process of change and the momentum of this process of change will cause structural adjustment difficulties on both sides . 
particular attentio. and here i agree with the previous speake. needs to be paid to border regions . 
although there are excellent medium - term prospects for the border regions within the european union , huge adjustment difficulties will need to be overcome in the short term . 
we already have experience of both from enlargement to spain and portugal . 
w. the member states first , but also the e. have a duty to provide suitable support for border regions . 
mr president , we might be inclined to think that when new countries join the eu , this automatically means that they will have to introduce more stringent rules to protect the environment and nature . 
this may be true in part , where the protection of the environment is concerned , but when it comes to protecting nature , it is a different matter . 
the candidate countries want to experience quick economic growth , even if this is at the expense of previously stipulated nature protection policy . 
of those candidate countries , it is mainly the eastern european countries which have a rich tradition of identifying and protecting nature reserves . 
accordingly , their decision in favour of rail transport , which takes up less space and emits less polluting substances than road transport , was a sound one . 
this head start has been put at risk over the past decade , mainly by the impoverishment of a large section of the population and by the wish for a new , car - oriented infrastructure . 
some candidate countries would like financial support from the european union for projects which will need to be abandoned once they join the union . 
we need to try to protect the countryside and the natural areas from any negative impact . 
i welcome the broad approval from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and i hope for the same from parliament as a whole . 
. mr president , when pandora opened her box all the ills of mankind were released . 
that would happen with or without enlargement . 
you cannot erect some new curtain , some cordon sanitaire , to protect west from east and east from west . 
enlargement or no , it is in our mutual and collective interest that such problems are dealt with . 
it is my belief that enlargement can help that process . 
since the 1950s in europe we have introduced standards on health and safety and over the years we have extended competences and standards from public health to health promotion , tobacco to blood safety , rights from mobility of doctors and patients to human rights and laws such as those for mental health . 
pharmaceutical companies have been regulated , medicines for people and animals licensed , and a range of measures taken in research , dissemination of good practice , education and training . 
we are building a compendium of directives and regulations on matters wholly germane to health , such as pollution , emissions of radioactive and other dangerous substances , waste disposal , water , air , soil quality , food safety and novel foods and product liability . 
now we are moving to a requirement for health impact assessments for all major legislation . 
it is a long list and one that is often more honoured in the breach than in the observance by member states . 
there is a message for eu governments and indeed for the commission : for governments on compliance and the commission on enforcement . 
ladies and gentlemen , we are not always able to clearly explain these pitfalls to our citizens nor propose clear and acceptable solutions . 
somebody said here today that enlargement is not a priority for 60 % of the people consulted by the latest eurobarometer . 
the report on the opinion of the committee on regional policy , transport and touris. of which i am rapporteu. has therefore had to play a dual role . 
my report is also bound to discuss the european union and has to demonstrate that the european funds for regional development cannot continue to be granted on the basis of a simple distribution of money between regions or districts . 
if we do not establish priorities from a continent - wide perspective and straightaway , we will waste precious time , a few very important years in the task of constructing a strong and united continent . 
it is essential , ladies and gentlemen , to create a genuine european regional planning policy , of which the structural funds are a component , an element , but which gives rise to ambitious actions in favour of balanced and integrated development of the european area in its different dimensions . 
it is necessary to develop this european plan , link it clearly to regional policy and to the reform which is going to be implemented in 2006 . 
we must begin to discuss this integrated and polycentric european development . 
the moment to move forward will perhaps arrive after the next intergovernmental conference . 
the european parliament and its committee on regional policy , which also has competence in the field of transport and the trans - european networks , is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different community sectoral policies in favour of a global policy of regional planning . 
the european commission works on the basis of this same hypothesis and will put forward some of its proposals in the second triennial report on cohesion which it will present to parliament in december . 
we know that this is perhaps not the ideal moment politically , but there is also a need to discuss the current financial perspectives negotiated at the berlin european council , which do not seem to us to be sufficient to confront the challenges of the regional policy and the economic and social cohesion of an enlarged european union . 
ladies and gentlemen , cohesion and european citizenship are one and the same thing . 
helmut schmidt and valéry giscard d ' estaing put it another way : the only way we can create realistic and viable integration is through political will and socio - economic conditions which are almost identical . 
mr president , allow me to start with a preliminary comment , not on the subject of austria , but on another political matter . 
the french presidency changed its political presence here in the house prior to the reports on the two candidate countries of cyprus and malta . 
i trust that this is not an indication of how the grande nation intends to treat small partners ; it would be the wrong signal . 
but now to the right signals . 
elmar brok rightly started his intervention by saying that we all stand to benefit from enlargement , especially those of us on this side of the current external borders . 
commissioner verheugen , you rightly stressed that it was no longer a question of if , but of how and when enlargement will take place . 
but it is precisely with the " how " and " when " that we need to ensure that enlargement is prepared carefully and implemented seriously , in order to guarantee its success . 
the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has tried , within its remit , to take account of two sub - sectors which mr brok addressed and which must be borne in mind if enlargement is to be a success . 
we have just heard something about the " carrot " in the regional policy and promotion sector . 
whether or not they will suffice remains to be seen ; in any event a sound basis has been laid for the candidate countries with phare , ispa and other funding programmes . 
but there must also be a sound basis and it is particularly important for the infrastructure to be created in the candidate countries , in order to ensure that acceptance of the community acquis is not and does not just remain acceptance on paper . 
the committee has basically endeavoured in the individual transport strategies to highlight the most important aspects . 
there are two very important aspects in connection with road and rail transport which deserve special mention here : as regards road transport , which has already been liberalised and opened up to an extensive degree , care must be taken to ensure on accession that the provisions of community employment , social , fiscal and tax legislation are actually applied in each member state because , if they are not , this will lead to distortions of the market in the european union and in the candidate countries which , where possible , we shall then have to spend a great deal of money rectifying . 
similar early action is needed and will be needed in order to join the western and eastern european railway network and render them compatible . 
we must ensure that the present rail infrastructure in central and eastern europe is not replaced by road transport , resulting in a great deal of effort at a later date in an attempt to put things right . 
internal waterway transport will be important for environmental reasons , because we must get heavy freight off the roads and , if it cannot be carried by rail , then we must use waterways . 
once malta and cyprus join , the union will have the biggest merchant fleet in the world . 
it is important that it should not just become a flag of convenience and that all measures prescribed in the acquis are taken to ensure that safety is writ large . 
another lesson from denmark , which is directly relevant to the committee on whose behalf i am speaking , is that everything suggests that there are far more women than men who have voted ' no ' . 
if we are not to risk a repeat performance in the candidate countries , it is crucial that we be clear about the fact that enlargement should not be of benefit only to men but also be of benefit to women . 
i believe that , up until now , all objective investigations have shown that the transition to a market economy has had a greater impact upon women than upon men . 
mr president , commissioner , i only have two minutes and must dispense with references to honeymoons . 
after such a comprehensive debate , i should just like to address and highlight two questions , which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye . 
the first is the question of the reforms needed in the european union itself . 
as a result of the intergovernmental conference , the conditions needed in order for the european union to be able to enlarge will be in place . 
all too often we stand with raised finger pointing in the direction of the candidates and lecture them on their obligations , when what we should do is point in our own direction and understand once and for all that , when it comes to fulfilling obligations , our turn comes well before theirs . 
we believe we must teach them about democracy , but do you not think that countries which have experienced dictatorship know better than we do what is important in democracy ? 
what we need , of course , is for the new member states from the east to help us keep to what is the purpose of it all , namely a union of free and sovereign member states in which the freedom of the people and the nations is given pride of place . 
they can perhaps teach us to use the proximity principle somewhat better . 
if there are rules which are unsuited to the new countries , then it is perhaps the rules which should be adapted and not the new countries which should adjust . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are gathered here today to discuss the applications for membership of the european union from twelve european countries : ten in eastern europe and two from the mediterranean , malta and cyprus . 
these countries see the present european union as a guarantee of future prosperity . 
some of them , a short while ago oppressed by communism and subjugated by the soviet empire , or still divided by military occupation like cyprus , also see it as a guarantee of independence and security . 
he also told you that expressing a point of view other than his was to indulge in populism . 
populism is how technocrats choose to denigrate the will of the people when it is expressed in a direction which does not suit them . 
tomorrow will tell . 
ladies and gentlemen , we shall now stop for a break and something to eat and shall resume at 9 o ' clock . 
i trust that there will be a full turnout ! 
progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries ( continued ) 
we now continue with the joint debate on progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries . 
mr president , commissioner , many people form the impression that enlargement of the eu is a project which is going to cost an incredible amount of money . 
that is not an entirely correct description of how things look in reality , as noted as early as during the berlin summit in march 1999 when the budget guidelines were drawn up . 
in the opinion on the brok report , for which i was responsible and which has been backed by the committee on budgets , the conclusion is the same . 
the vast majority of international investigations point to macroeconomic gains in connection with enlargement . 
this applies to the candidate countries , but in fact it also applies to all current member states . 
to these should be added all the other advantages which cannot be measured in figures or assessed in economic terms . 
through enlargement , we shall be participating in the largest common market in the world , with almost 500 million people and 25 per cent of world trade . 
we shall obtain increased competition and a more rapid process of reform in western europe too . 
better conditions for economic growth will be created throughout europe . 
albeit in a somewhat longer time - scale , we shall be obtaining a common currency for the whole continent . 
we shall acquire an extended and stable democracy and , with it , opportunities for enduring peace on what has been a constantly war - torn continent . 
the composite picture of enlargement does not therefore point to insuperable costs but to gains , however the calculations are carried out . 
they are so great that enlargement ought to be undertaken as soon as it possibly can be . 
mr president , slovenia has succeeded in achieving the majority of the short - term priority objectives of the pre - accession partnership and this positive evaluation is helping to provide fresh impetus for the negotiations . 
there are only a few days to go before the slovenian general elections . 
this is not the most opportune moment for it to focus on foreign policy and the interchanges between the different parties could become heated and exploitative . 
however , with the exception of insignificant minorities , no political group is questioning the principle objective of the slovenian policy which is to join the european union as soon as possible . 
the political line therefore remains unchanged . 
the report on slovenia presents us with a problem which is also part of the czech question , the croatian question and the situation of other nations . 
however , at various different stages , always during or immediately following the second world war , measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the copenhagen criteria , given the prevailing spirit at the time , and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period , including the peace treaties , was founded on precisely those laws . 
we could specify a basic version of the acquis , which would contain core parts of the eea agreements and a common foreign and security policy . 
in addition to adopting and implementing this basic version , the new members would obviously have to fulfil the copenhagen criteria , agree to adopt the acquis in its entirety as a longer - term objective , and commit to the political goals of the union . 
it is for these reasons and , more importantly , because of our own experience in greece , that our opposition to the enlargement of the european union is meant as an expression of brotherly solidarity to the workers and people in general in the candidate countries . 
we call on these people to join with the people of the european union in fighting a european union which exploits and interferes , including militarily , which fleeces the people of their wealth and the fruits of their labour and which abolishes the social rights for which they have fought so hard and sacrificed so much for so long . 
we call on them to fight for a different europe of all the people , a europe without this inhumane side , in which people will defend their destiny and live with each other in peace , freedom , comradeship and mutually beneficial cooperation . 
as far as cyprus is concerned , despite the fact that the poos report contains much that is true , we feel , in addition to the foregoing , that the process of integration into the european union and the decisions taken at helsinki will not only fail to resolve the problem of the occupation in accordance with un resolutions ; they will legitimise the occupation and the definitive partition of the island . 
and , for the record , we note that the question of the withdrawal of the occupying army was hardly even touched on when the occupying force was granted candidate status . 
finally , because there has been much talk today of the tenth anniversary of the reunification of germany , i should like to ask the council and mr verheugen if they have any idea when this unified germany intends , having occupied greece , to pay the loan needed for war reparations . 
mr president , i want to focus my remarks on the orphanages in romania . 
i believe that the romanian government has problems in estimating the number of orphans who are presently in the orphanage system in that country . 
in correspondence received by the european commission delegation office in bucharest from the romanian government it is estimated that there are between 100 000 and 140 000 orphans in romania at present . 
i had the opportunity of meeting with non - governmental organisations in romania which are working with the orphanages . 
the consequences of failing to take the fisheries policy into account could prove disastrous and should not be dismissed merely by referring to solidarity amongst the nations . 
i would urge you to support the relevant amendments . 
and even the european politicians have insufficient insight into the negotiating process . 
if this situation does not change , the whole reunification will be up in the air . 
mr poos brings a european vision to bear on the subject of cyprus . 
cyprus will be a sort of bridge with the countries in the area . 
i have no need to raise the economic dimension , it is covered thoroughly and dynamically in the poos report and the reports by the other institutions of the european union . 
i would merely remind the house that , of all the candidate countries , cyprus comes first as regards meeting the economic criteria and qualifies for immediate membership of emu . 
cyprus will have no trouble adjusting to the acquis communautaire . 
unfortunately , these sentiments have had to yield to technical arguments in the course of the negotiations . 
the requirement for becoming an eu member state is that of complying with the basic copenhagen criteria . 
negotiations must , in the first place , be aimed at easing the way to accession by the candidate countries . 
blatant discrimination occurs in other countries such as poland and malta . 
in poland recently , the former president , lech walensa , told a campaign rally , ' i believe these people ( gays ) need medical treatment . 
imagine if they were all like that ! 
we would not have any descendants . 
i am only referring to this to illustrate that simple solutions do not generally help solve complicated issues . 
there is no doubt that the diversity of cultures and peoples in central and eastern europe , and in the balkans , is , within the framework of a unified europe , being given new opportunities , but at the same time , europe will also need to realise that a problem such as the roma , for example , is a problem of a nation without a country and that is our problem too . 
we cannot simply pass the buck to slovakia , romania or the other countries . 
mr president , i have no intention of digging over old ground a month before the next progress reports are due to be published . 
as shadow rapporteur for lithuania , on behalf of my group , i would , however , like to congratulate mrs hoff on her report . 
above all though , i would like to bring various expectations and reservations that i have , to the attention of the council , which , i am sorry to say , is largely absent . 
unfortunately , it seems to me , that for all the fine words and industrious opening and closing of chapters , the council is not applying the political pressure needed to drive this enlargement process forward . 
those who subordinate historic decisions to petty national , or even party political considerations , will not earn their place in the history books . 
i urge you to set a deadline in nice by which you intend to conclude negotiations with those candidate countrie. naming no name. that have made the most progress . 
let us all stop asking them for things that do not fall within the scope of the acquis communautaire . 
whilst there are certain honourable members here who should heed this , the message is intended primarily for the ears of the national council delegations attending the negotiations . 
the way individual governments allow particular lobbyists to manipulate and take advantage of them to a certain extent , in the course of negotiations , is sometimes unworthy of them . 
perhaps a constructive dialogue between the government , the opposition parties and social representatives could provide a positive impetus to move things in the right direction . 
this dialogue would also contribute to the creation of the necessary administrative capacity for the effective management of the country , creating structures which do not currently exist and reducing cases of corruption . 
many countries have faced similar problems at some time in their development and can advise bulgaria in order to help it to overcome those problems it is facing at the moment . 
in bulgaria , 20 % of the active population is out of work . 
in addressing problems such as this , which have no easy solution , it is essential to create an environment conducive to the work of industry and to there being competitive economic structures . 
bulgaria also has an important geopolitical role to play in the future of the balkans . 
its cooperation with the international community during the kosovo conflict , and its balanced role at that time , are of great importance for the whole region . 
in fact , bulgaria uses its position as a bridge between central europe and the balkans in a way that is fruitful for everyone . 
the european union must continue to help bulgaria in its progress towards joining the union and , of course , to ensure that the planning of that aid becomes even more decentralised . 
if we want the process of enlargement to take place in a serious and honest way , we will have to give a commitment to two essential issues . 
if malta is only permitted four meps then this will further entrench the two - party system over there , which has been founded on confrontation for decades , and it will hinder political innovation . 
malta should be represented by a minimum of six meps , like the other smaller member states . 
democracy is not just about majorities , more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers . 
i hope that is the spirit in which malta will accede to the european union . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , ' from problem child to model pupil ' , that is how we could characterise the determination of the slovakian government and the slovakian parliament to swiftly tread the path to eu membership , and to spend the past two years making every available effort to fulfil the copenhagen criteria . 
we hope that the slovakian parliament and the government will pursue this course resolutely and find the patience they need to overcome opposition and strengthen the slovakian people on their way to europe . 
we have noted with satisfaction that the slovakian parliament is conscious of what needs to be done for slovakia to be able to accede to the eu , and has set about trying to accomplish this systematically and rapidly . 
we are also aware that , being a transit country in central europe for those on their way to western europe , the slovak republic has a special duty to take a pro - active stance against trafficking in human beings , and to fight corruption and organised crime with even more determination than before , and we have noted that the executive judiciary has been further strengthened by recent changes in the law . 
mr president , members of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , enlargement beyond the former iron curtain is the work of peace . 
all this is to be found in the report by baroness nicholson of winterbourne , and on behalf of my group , i would like to thank her warmly for this report . 
romania did not set out on the road to europe until a very long time after the fall of the iron curtain . 
the democratic government has only had since 1996 to catch up on all the things that other countries were able to make an early start on , and with that in mind , it has achieved a considerable amount of success these past four years . 
a word about how matters stand on the security front : romania was one of those countries that gave europe , and the atlantic alliance its backing during the kosovo conflict . 
we should therefore take this opportunity to think about sending out a signal . 
the gains are mainly to be found at the political level . 
it is fantastic that countries on this continent which only ten or so years ago were divided are to make joint decisions on matters of common interest in the near future . 
this transformation has benefits in terms of democracy and provides the opportunity to create peace and stability in the future . 
it has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically , but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in europe . 
we shall see benefits in terms of the environment . 
i myself live close to the baltic , which matters to us all . 
when we devise common rules which improve the environment , we create better conditions of life for the future . 
that is our common task . 
the report states that each country must accede to the eu on its own merits . 
it is important that this should happen and that a country should be able to become a member of the eu when it is ready to join . 
we now have two tasks before us : firstly , to encourage the member states not to abandon their efforts , which is why we need to present a target date soon ; and secondly to lead the debate with the people in our own countries so that this project enjoys legitimacy in the future too . 
mr president , commissioner verheugen said this afternoon that there would be no social or environmental dumping as a result of enlargement . 
i believe this is an important goal and all those involved must do their bit to ensure that we achieve this goal . 
the points raised by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy in the brok report are the steps we need to take to this end , and it is essential that we take them if we are to counteract any slowing of the pace on the european environmental policy front . 
we can take it as read that considerable strides have been made , particularly since the last reports were published . 
as vice - president of our joint parliamentary committee with the czech republic , i can vouch for the fact that this is true of the czech republic , but i assume the same applies to a number of other states too . 
the internal market is a key component in the success of enlargement and it is therefore clear to me that we must tread extremely carefully when it comes to exemptions and transitional periods . 
however , in common with our rapporteur , mr wuermeling , i believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods , and being a delegate from a border region , who , like mrs schierhuber , owns a farm in the vicinity of the czech border , it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close , common economic areas should be managed without any major problems , and lead to a positive outcome on both sides . 
i would like to close with a comment from the report by mr schröder , which pleased me enormously , and which , as i see it , also captures the spirit of what commissioner verheugen said at the beginning of this debate . 
although the following statement by mr schröder only relates to the czech republic , i believe the same applies across the board : ' many weaknesses that are still discernible in the czech republic are the legacy of decades of dictatorship . 
this being so , politicians from the part of europe which after the second world war enjoyed a happier fate. and this is particularly true of austri. would be well - advised to be moderate in their criticism of the countries such as the czech republic. ' 
we in the european union also undertake regular checks as to whether human rights are being upheld in the proper manner everywhere . 
in this sense , it is a process of development , which we follow attentively , but we hope that slovenia will continue to hold this positive position and that it will be in the first group . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have picked the right moment to discuss enlargement . 
the fact that there has been a reunited germany in the european union for ten years now , bears witness to the solidarity between us . other countries should now be given the chance to share in this , even though enlargement is not just about solidarity . 
the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism incorporated its position on the rack report into the brok report . 
as a social democrat , there are three points i would like to highlight . 
mr president , it is to be hoped that the fact that the issue of equal opportunities is the last point to be discussed in the report on enlargement , is no reflection of its status , although it sometimes looks that way . 
it is therefore all the more important that equal treatment for men and women should be incorporated into the acquis communautaire as a fundamental human rights issue , and that establishing the necessary institutions in this sphere should be a crucial precondition to the implementation of the acquis communautaire . 
accordingly , equal opportunities must be accorded the same importance , and be discussed with the same level of commitment as all the other issues that feature on the agenda of the accession negotiations . 
the candidate countries ' legislative programmes and guidelines must include implementation mechanisms that allow for equal opportunities and clearly prohibit discrimination . 
both the eu and the candidate states should now be doing their utmost to condemn and fight these forms of violence and the trade in women . 
a great deal of progress has already been made , i am glad to say , but these countries must not direct all their efforts at economic harmonisation alone . 
mr president , commissioner , allow me to start by thanking the rapporteur , mr brok , and the rapporteurs of the individual reports on each candidate country for their extremely thorough and balanced work . 
we must accord this political process the historic importance it deserves and enter into discussion with the citizens . 
we need to politicise the politics of the enlargement process if we are to have the ability to engage in meaningful conversation with the citizens . 
the enlargement process and the economic and monetary union are not just a matter for the european institutions . 
i call upon the member states and all public mandate holders and media at all levels to become more actively involved in this process , because only then will we be able to do justice to public confidence in these initiatives , the objects of which are in the interests of us all . 
that concludes the joint debate . 
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m . 
( the sitting was closed at 10.45 p.m ) . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
are there any comments ? 
i regard that as discrimination . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in his policy statement yesterday , mr prodi , the president of the commission , said that whoever weakened any institution of the european union weakened the union as a whole . 
we have , of course , debated the relations between the commission and the council here . 
i should like to refer to the relations between parliament and the council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the council 's replies to our written questions . 
let me cite two examples . 
in september 1999 i asked a question on the subject of hombach . 
it was answered in february 2000 . 
i submitted a written question on the subject of european flight safety in february 2000 and am still awaiting a reply . 
whoever weakens any institution weakens the entire union . 
i have the impression that the council in particular has now decided to ignore questions from parliament . 
that is unacceptable ! 
if we are to preserve the balance between the institutions , i believe we must take steps to ensure that this defect is rectified . 
thank you . 
are there any other comments on the minutes ? 
there are none . 
( the minutes were approved ) 
however , i must express my concer. and i ask that the presidency communicate this to the prague authoritie. at the fact that two young spaniards , gaizka azcona cueva , 22 years old , and mikel oliva martínez , 21 years old , have been detained arbitrarily since last tuesda. nearly ten days . 
it is worrying that this can happen in a country which is going to join the european union . 
mr marset campos , we shall certainly take note of your statement . 
i am sure that mrs fontaine will do all that needs to be done . 
agenda 
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has requested that the debate on the oral question to the commission on the rights of language teachers , which is currently scheduled to take place on friday morning , be postponed until the next part - session . 
i give the floor to mr maccormick , who will present the request on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
mr president , the question concerning language teachers which has been put down for this friday comes from the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
it was the intention of those who tabled that question in the committee that it should come before the house accompanied by a motion for a resolution . 
we are discussing a serious matter . 
from time to time it is rightly said in this house that a citizens ' europe would be a europe in which rights were properly enshrined in the law of the union . 
that would be no good if rights already in the law can be flouted by the member states . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
i am very sorry , mr wuermeling , but the minutes have been approved . 
i asked three times if there were any comments and the minutes are now deemed to be approved . 
i am genuinely sorry , but i must stop you there . 
2000 / 0068 ( cod ) ) . 
mr president , today we are to discuss , and perhaps vote on , a total of three reports which deal with this subject , two of them mine . 
they constitute the first steps on the long , long road towards ensuring food safety for all 370 million inhabitants of europe . 
we might well hope that , before the whole of this package is in place , there will be very many more of us , as citizens , who are affected by these rules . 
this is the first step , and it is now also a question of establishing incredibly important principles before the work as a whole begins . 
in both of these re - worked draft directives , i have tried to use a form of language which is readable . 
a legal text should be precise enough for it to be possible to comply with it . 
i have therefore made a lot of the language more straightforward and tried to simplify matters and make them crystal - clear . 
when it comes to limit values , which must be set extremely rigorously in the future to check unwelcome developments , i would ask you to take account of the problems which low limit values , for example for dioxin , will mean for , for example , fishing communities in the baltic , in parts of the north sea and probably in mediterranean coastal areas . 
i would also ask you to take account of farmers whose fields border either very busy roads or industries which have contaminated large areas . 
many of these instances of poisoning or cases in which heavy metals were dispersed occurred before there was sufficient environmental awareness and before it was known what the effects would be . 
we cannot find the culprits . 
i would ask that we take account of these individual fishermen and farmers in future because they are innocent and are being hit by financial ruin . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we want to guarantee the safety of animal feed and human foodstuffs , and to that end we need a workable european regulatory framework . 
the crises of recent years have made everyone , including ourselves , more keenly aware of the situation . 
i should like to inform the house that amendments nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which the ppe - de group tabled , have been withdrawn . 
what is new in the present proposal is that it gives member states scope to operate with action thresholds , which would enable them to use their own discretion as long as the established ceilings were not exceeded . 
in the context of a necessary european regulatory system , such discretionary scope surely entails a risk to producers as well as jeopardising trade and transactions . 
mr president , " healthy and properly monitored from stable to table " . that is now the phrase that sums up the policy on protecting consumers and the food chain that the european union wanted . 
this was absolutely vital . 
the dioxin crisis that struck belgium over a year ago made a deep impression on people all over europe . 
this crisis not only cost billions of euros , but also resulted in even more suspicion about what we eat . 
more than ever before , the public is calling on us to act and is demanding strict standards , which will guarantee healthy food . 
this directive is the first link in a long series of decisions to be taken on food safety . 
what can i say in one minute ? 
very briefly , we must insist on amendment no 37, concerning dioxins . 
the standards that we are demanding are , admittedly , extremely high but , until more accurate scientific studies are available , we must not take any risks . 
pcbs and dioxins are toxic substances , even in very small quantities . 
more than ever before , this consumer needs reassurance . 
this directive will contribute to food being , as i said before , healthy and of high quality from the stable to the table . 
this is what the public demands . 
zero risk is , of course , impossible , but an early warning system must nevertheless be put in place . 
member states must , moreover , pay close attention to monitoring the implementation of texts . 
on this point we are in agreement . 
mr president , it is the duty of this parliament and this commission to protect the health of all citizens of the european union . 
that is what we are trying to do in this report , on which i congratulate mrs paulsen . 
certainly the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy was the correct committee to bring these proposals forward in view of what we have heard . 
we have had to learn lessons from the dioxin scandal . 
if we are going to propose that , for example , there should be a tenfold reduction in the materials which are permitted to enter the european union for blending down by approved food manufacturers , we ought to be certain that there is a sound scientific basis for that proposal . 
these directives are part of the most radical shake - up of the community 's food safety hygiene rules for at least 25 years . 
the new regulations will merge , harmonise and simplify very detailed and complex hygiene requirements which were previously scattered over numerous directives . 
we have all learned our lesson from the food crisis of the 90s . 
i am confident that with this systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation and enhancing food safety throughout the food chain . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the wake of numerous food scandals , consumer awareness has heightened very considerably . 
in the domain of eu consumer policy , i believe ' from stable to table ' has few rival claimants to the title of expression of the year . 
consumer safety begins with animal feed , with its ingredients , the declaration and , last but not least , the official inspections . 
these three reports place us on the horns of a dilemma . 
as for the declaration of feed material. the open versus the semi - open declaratio. our dilemma is surely between consumer protection and economic viability . 
any manufacturers who therefore wish to discover precisely what a competing company is offering its customers have long been able to acquire this information . 
after the committee meeting i really felt we needed just to extend a helping hand to the producer . 
the farmer must obviously be compensated for the destruction of a batch of feed that is so contaminated that it is unfit for use , just as in the case , for example , of the destruction of animals with tse . 
compensation is necessary , although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals . 
the committee also adopted the amendment we tabled , reminding everyone of the division that exists in respect of rules for feedingstuffs produced on farms and commercially produced feedingstuffs . 
the good quality of the former is regulated by legislation on hygiene and the directive on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is most essential with regard to the latter . 
this division should also be maintained in the future . 
if hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended . 
this proposal will without doubt enhance the safety of feed . 
prohibition of dilution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed . 
operators at every stage in the production chain will be forced to put systems and practices in place to ensure that the feed materials and feedingstuffs they produce are safe . 
it will encourage a proactive approach to reducing contamination in the feed chain . 
i am therefore very pleased that ms paulsen 's report endorses these main principles of the commission proposal . 
the commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in the rapporteur 's report . 
however , let me first address the amendments with which the commission cannot agree . 
amendment no 18 explicitly proposes to include water in the definition of feedingstuff . 
i fully agree that the same rules concerning the quality of feedingstuffs have to apply to the quality of water consumed by animals . 
although the definition does not preclude water being considered as feedingstuff , it is clear from the community legislation that water has not until now been considered as feedingstuff , as is clear from the fact that council directive 96 / 25 of 29 april 1996 on the circulation of feed materials , containing a non - exhaustive list of the main feed materials , does not include water in the list . 
the commission cannot , therefore , accept this amendment , but will consider it in the context of a future amendment to that directive . 
amendment no 33 deletes the possibility of exporting non - complying consignments to the country of origin . 
the commission cannot accept this amendment . 
the possibility of re - exporting non - complying consignments to the country of origin should remain open . 
however , in order to meet parliament 's concern the commission accepts that it is appropriate to insert an additional provision that re - export is possible after informing the competent authority of the country of origin and receiving assurances that the contaminated lot will be safely disposed of 
finally , the commission cannot accept amendment nos 35, 36 and 37, proposing to amend the maximum limits for cadmium , mercury , lead dioxin and pcbs in certain feedingstuffs , since amendments to the annexes have to be based on a scientific risk assessment and have to be made by the commission following the committee procedure . 
in relation to pcbs , work is currently being undertaken by the relevant scientific committee . 
it is expected that this committee will report in october , by which time we will be in a position to consider what appropriate action can be taken under comitology . 
the commission will review the current provisions concerning cadmium and mercury as a priority and will ask the scientific committee for animal nutrition to provide a scientific risk assessment for these heavy metals . 
this has already been done for dioxins and pcbs and it can be expected that this scientific risk assessment will become available , as i said , in october . 
on the basis of these scientific risk assessments the commission will propose to the member states appropriate measures to limit the presence of these substances in feedingstuffs . 
the european parliament will , of course , be fully informed . 
however , i noted also the objections in council to the total prohibition of dilution , but i am convinced that an acceptable solution can be found in order to prevent feedingstuffs becoming the waste bucket for contaminants . 
in the second stage we will be able to address the issues raised by mr whitehead in relation to these particular matters . 
regarding amendment nos 20, the commission can accept the insertion of a definition for consignment but the proposed definition itself needs further consideration as does the need to include other definitions . 
to conclude , i wish once again to thank mrs paulsen for the excellent report which can be supported by the commission to a very large extent . 
now i want to turn to the second major proposal for discussion today with important implications for food safety . 
once again i would like to thank mrs paulsen and mrs auroi for the broad support given in their reports to the commission proposal concerning controls in animal nutrition . 
this proposal is the follow - up to one of my first commitments to improve food safety and provides for a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition , with particular reference to a rapid alert system and a legal basis to enable the adoption of safeguards measures for products produced within the community and also the obligation for the member states to have in place contingency plans to deal with feed emergencies . 
considering the amendments tabled for adoption in this plenary session , i appreciate parliament 's support of the proposal . 
on behalf of the commission , i can accept amendments nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 23, 25 and 26 because they provide clarification and increase transparency . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 2, 14, 1. the first sentence in particula. and 19 concerning the deletion of the adjective " serious " when clarifying a risk for consistency with our general policy laid down in the general products safety directive . 
in other terms , not all risks need immediate action at community level . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 5 and 22 on the rapid alert system as they are currently worded . 
the commission agrees to the addition in amendment no 5 of the reference to changes in the current rapid alert system and i quote " after certain changes " . 
this should be sufficient , considering our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering all the food and feed chain in the new proposal on the food authority . 
in principle , i am not against amendments nos 15, 16, 2. last paragrap. concerning the change from " decontamination " to " rendering the product harmless " however we will introduce some editorial changes in relation to that . 
on amendment nos 17, i accept the principle that the use of dangerous products shall be prohibited and that they should be recalled . 
the amendment needs editorial changes to make clear that these actions are within the responsibilities of the member states . 
we cannot accept amendment no 21, second indent , ( a ) , because there is a linguistic misunderstanding : " cross - contamination " is the appropriate wording to be used . 
2000 / 0015 ( cod ) ) . 
mr graefe zu baringdorf has the floor . 
commissioner byrne , in this directive on the marketing of compound feed we find our old problem lurking , namely the question of open declarations . 
we accepted the bulk of your amendments in the committee on agriculture and rural development , but the substance of the commission draft is fine , and we shall support it in this form . 
the compound - feed industry , however , has been trying yet again to exert influence through the council and to overturn the principle of open declarations . 
so that in itself has already made my morning . 
mr graefe zu baringdorf , the rapporteur from the committee which was ultimately entrusted with responsibility for this report , said that we have long been pressing for this open declaration and that we have redoubled our exhortations to the commission on the marketing of compound feed since the bse episode . 
he rightly praised the commission for its more or less prompt fulfilment of its mandates . 
the commission 's proposal is sound , and i am convinced that we shall muster enough agreement within the house on the few amendments to be able to stand up to the council on this issue . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , speaking for my group , i assume that the report on the proposal for a directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs will obtain the consent of the european parliament . 
i also expect the commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the member states of the union . 
the basis for the introduction of open declarations , in other words the full listing of all feed materials , differs extremely widely between member states . 
the standards are scarcely comparable , let alone transferable . 
in the long production chain for compound feedingstuffs , there are sharply divergent degrees of interest in the traceability of feed materials . 
the bse scandal was the worst and most notorious example . 
let me finish by stressing that the report , like the labelling of beef , will come down on the side of the consumer more than on that of the production chain . 
given the surplus production in europe , this is the safer bet and will pay dividends in the long run . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , after the issue of the composition of feedingstuffs for animals , if we are to eliminate mercury , lead , arsenic , ddt , etc. , we must address the question of the way in which these products are marketed . 
this is , of course , all due to the bse tragedy that turned into a real saga , with several episodes . 
mr böge dealt with the episode of the committee of inquiry in 1997, there was the episode of the ban on british beef , the episode of the labelling of meat and now we have the episode of labelling animal feedingstuffs . 
of course , farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil , which contains dioxins . 
food must therefore be labelled to show the precise contents . 
this is a simple thing , but for ten years , we have sat and twiddled our thumbs . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a surfeit of scandals has shaken public and consumer confidence . 
in the interests of farmers and consumers , we need clear and transparent rules for animal feed too , but it should be said that farmers are always the first to suffer when abuses occur . 
as far as the directive on undesirable products and substances in animal nutrition is concerned , let me say from the outset that we need a more workable solution here which strikes a fair balance between the interests of producers and those of consumers . 
we must create a realistic statutory framework . 
contaminants which affect human and animal health are unacceptable . 
you know i come from a member state where very high and strict standards are imposed , which i fully support , and those standards have certainly proved their worth . 
as far as checks on feedingstuffs are concerned , i should like to state that the problem is not so much the lack of a european legal framework as the failure of the individual member states to transpose the existing provisions . 
i cannot but warmly welcome the pressure for the creation of a european information system for food crises , the standardised transmission of information on the monitoring and safety of animal feed and the dissemination of information on cases of contamination and of damage to public health and the environment . 
for that reason , subjects such as animal feed really ought to be dealt with under the direction of the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
what we feed our livestock is just as important to us farmers as it is to the consumers who subsequently buy our meat . 
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts and praise the important work of the institutions in their approach to animal health which also , of course , facilitates the protection of human health . 
this proposal falls within the framework of the legislation intended to strengthen the rules on feedingstuffs , included in the white paper on food safety . 
therefore , parliament , as well as the commission , demands mandatory labelling which specifies the compositio. as a percentage by weight , as mr cunha said - , the quantities and the origin of the ingredients of the feedingstuffs , rather than indicating the categories of the ingredients with no further detail , such as , for example , by proteins or by oils and fats , which has had so much to do with previous scandals such as the cases of bse and dioxins . 
the demand that manufacturers provide proof of the composition of foods , and that there be an exhaustive and up - to - date list of authorised raw materials and rigorous controls of suspicious material. and their immediate withdrawal from the marke. must from now on be essential issues for us . 
i am grateful that this matter is finally coming to its conclusion and that we are going to have a solution as swiftly as possible . 
but let us begin with the good news . 
the commission proposal to lend more transparency to the information given on labels and on feed content , so that everyone knows where they stand , is a step in the right direction . 
it is also what we want , namely trust between the producer and consumer . 
the tighter measures which the rapporteur announced in his report and which encompass , for example , an exhaustive list of products , for which he calls on the commission for help , is an interesting proposal and will only reinforce this policy . 
it is unfortunate , however , that we are still not , in fact , taking matters one step further and establishing certain labelling obligations with regard to energy and foodstuffs , too . 
this is the good news . 
the bad news is that those who tamper with cattle feed will no. now or in futur. specify on the label whether the product contains dioxin or substances which have not been effectively processed . 
that means that in europe , there is definitely room for improvement with regard to policy on enforcement , but also on penalties , and it means that whoever tampers with animal feed or food commits a crime . 
you could say that you can put anything on paper , but in the final analysis , power will also need to reside in enforcement and penalties when the rules are broken . 
finally , i would like to note that , with this legislation , europe is probably going a great deal further than many other parts of the world . 
it imports a great deal of its cattle feed from the developing countries , among others , and the question remains of how we can put our legislation on the agenda at wto level and how we can solve this problem in an adequate manner , because it very definitely creates a difference in cost price compared to other parts of the world , and this will also need to be given due attention within the commission and in future discussions with the council . 
as stressed in the report by these two committees , this proposal was initiated by the european parliament out of a concern to improve both traceability and the provision of information through the labelling of compound - feeding stuffs . 
the commission proposal does not enjoy the unanimous support of all parties concerned . 
in the council , a very substantial majority of member states is opposed to the introduction of an obligation to systematically indicate on labels the precise composition of the compound feedingstuffs intended for productive livestock . 
if a compromise were to be reached , it would be highly desirable to give stock farmers the opportunity to obtain all the information they desire on the composition of the feedingstuffs used to feed their animals . 
in my opinion , this is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied . 
as far as the amendments presented are concerned , the commission can accept amendments nos 1, 3, 4 and 5 that improve the commission proposal . 
any updating of that list would be accomplished by comitology . 
i hope that parliament will understand that the commission cannot agree to give commitments on timescales which cannot be reasonably kept . 
finally , in relation to amendment no 6, this amendment is not acceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive . 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
mr swoboda , we quite agree . 
when we vote on these paragraphs , i shall ask if there are any objections to inserting them after paragraph 1 . 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
extending the european union , at least in the first stage , to more than 100 million new citizens , will provide new impetus for the development and integration of the european economy as a whole . 
the accession of new member states will provide the union with further weight and influence on the international stage . 
. ( es ) in the current context and given that we are beginning to hear enlargement being questioned in certain quarters , it is important that this parliament sends a clear political signal in support of it . 
i believe that enlargement will not only favour the prosperity and economic growth of the candidate countries and , by extension , that of the current member states of the union , but will , above all , also provide a guarantee of peace and stability in europe and thereby offer the european union the opportunity to finish the task of ensuring peace in europe , which began fifty years ago . 
we must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement , that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost . 
as we have already seen in connection with the integration of western european states into the european community , agriculture and food is one of the most complex areas of negotiation . 
each enlargement has required long - term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements , often lasting for several years . 
i believe that we are right to expect the applicant states of central and eastern europe to implement similar special and transitional measures . 
we should also do well to remember that , because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output , a competitive agricultural and food - supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries ' transformation and restructuring processes . 
. ( fr ) since its inception , the european union has sought to bring peoples closer together . 
although it may be difficult to have the various sensitivities , histories and , sometimes , contradictions live side by side , enlargement must adhere to this concept of peace and take part in the creation of a community that transcends ancient geographical and ideological borders , guided by common values and rules . 
nevertheless , in order to prevent europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area , the european union must provide clear answers to the institutional , social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise . 
we must , as of now , adopt a pragmatic approach to the implications of a europe not of 15, but of 25 or 30 . 
we must respond in an appropriate way to this enlargement which will considerably increase the number of poorer regions , and think carefully together about the risk of accentuating imbalances in europe , in order to ensure that europe does not become one huge heterogeneous mass . 
this is why we must show imagination in reformulating the criteria for granting structural aid , in order to guarantee appropriate support for the poorest regions of the candidate countries , as well as those in the current member states . 
the most important task for the popular movement against the eu is to internationalise popular resistance to the overall eu project . 
we voted against this report , but not because we are opposed to the principle of european enlargement . 
on the contrary , we feel that integrating peoples that have the democratic means to discuss and resolve this type of issue would be a positive step . 
the european institutions are not in the least bit interested in the opinion of the peoples of euroep , whether they are members of the european union or not . 
the various structural adjustment plans demand forced privatisations in all strategic sectors : finance , insurance , industry , education , and public services , etc. , and impose budgetary restrictions . 
ultimately , underdevelopment is on the increase and there is an explosion in poverty even in countries such as poland and hungary , which are meeting their targets for ' growth ' . 
so where is the ' progress ' for the populations of these countries who have never been consulted ? 
for years , in this house , we have been constantly proclaiming the perversity of this europe of yours , which is centralising and bureaucratic one day and federalist the next , this brussels - ridden europe which , despite its fine proclamations , denies national identities and cultures , the history of the nations of europe and history in general . 
enlargement must be considered in this new context and a transition strategy must be defined . 
less would have amounted to more ! 
i abstained in the vote on this never - ending resolution on enlargement because i believe that parliament would be doing a disservice to the politically important and worthy cause of eastward and southward enlargement of the european union to the south and east with this semi - digestible screed of paper . 
i even fear that this collection of country reports and comparative reports will prove counterproductive , particularly in the countries that have applied for membership of the european union , and more especially in the applicant countries of central and eastern europe . 
the impact of this long - winded resolution of 127 paragraphs , indeed , is liable to be in inverse proportion to its length . 
we should have made do with the country reports , adding at most a short , yet succinct resolution . 
our purpose , after all , should be to send the right signal from here , saying that we want these countries ' accession and that it should not be delayed , but also making it clear that enlargement must be economically , socially and financially manageable , both for the applicant countries and for the community . 
a realistic approach to manageability is not procrastinatio. it is quite the opposite . 
for many good reasons , not least among which is the desire to safeguard a lasting peace , we want the unification of the whole of europe , which is the only way to exclude the wars that my parents and i have experienced . 
that , in a few words , should have been our message today . 
we cannot and should not expect the applicant countries to go further than we ourselves have been able to go in implementing the established body of community law and practic. the acquis communautaire . 
cooperation and friendship with the former ussr nations and the mediterranean must progress alongside the enlargement process . 
secondly , enlargement inevitably involves revision of the european union 's financial perspectives , which were conceived and established before the prospect of enlargement was even on the horizon . 
take poland , hungary or the czech republic , to mention but a few of the ' candidate ' countries : how could we deny that they share our history , our culture and our origins ? 
this is not , of course , an invitation to shirk our responsibilities : we cannot forgo evaluating the transposal of the community acquis , just as it is necessary for the union to make good the commitments it has made to these states under the pre - accession strategy . 
we must not underestimate the need for healthy pragmatism in our handling of this extremely delicate transition stage , to avoid unnecessary clashes of principles . 
in general , we are all in favour of enlargement , but this will only fully come about when the candidate countries have carried out the necessary structural reforms , when the european union 's institutions and decision - making processes are capable of handling such a situation and , most importantly , when we at last realise that europe is not a question of political status but , more than anything else , a story of roots and common history , blood , sweat and tears , dreams and visions , which unite us above and beyond political and economic issues . 
carlsson report ( a5 - 0238 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i am very pleased to be able to announce that i voted for the measure on estonia 's application for membership of the european union . 
latvia is entitled to its place in this forum , not only because , on the whole , the progress it has made has earned it the right to this ' allocation of confidence ' that is essential in order to successfully concluded negotiations of this type , but more especially , and above all , because latvia is at home in europe as a european country . 
and so , in agreement with the observations and comments made by the rapporteur , i therefore welcome this dialogue and the prospects it gives rise to . 
i hope that latvia will have the opportunity to add the wealth of its own special characteristics to a european union which i too hope will , in the meantime , have opted to reorganise itself into a coherent political body that respects nations and their sovereignty , rather than a muddled board of shareholders of unequal standing that have lost sight of their primary objective , which is to build a strong , independent europe . 
hoff report ( a5 - 0240 / 2000 ) 
regarding the stage reached in the agreements on lithuania 's accession to the european union , i would like to take this important opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of lithuania . 
as the rapporteur , magdalene hoff , declared , it is important for the ignalina nuclear power station to be closed down , as it is particularly dangerous . 
i hope that , as the republic of lithuania has agreed , this nuclear power station will indeed be shut down . 
i welcome the hoff report on lithuania 's application for membership of the european union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws . 
i note that lithuania is making good progress to meeting both the copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire . 
. i welcome the gawronski report on poland 's application for membership of the european union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws . 
i welcome the schröder report on the czech republic 's application for membership of the european union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws . 
i note that the czech republic is making excellent progress towards meeting both the copenhagen criteria and fulfilling the acquis communautaire . 
if the czech republic continues to make progress and the european union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement i can see no reason why the czech republic should not be admitted to the union . 
i look forward to early membership for the czech republic . 
wiersma report ( a5 - 0244 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the report on the current status of slovakia 's application for membership of the european union . 
i would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that slovakia 's accession to the european union will alleviate the situation of slovakian pensioners and elderly people , a situation which is extremely damaging to the interests of all the citizens , particularly the elderly , in that their pensions are not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living . 
as mr wiersma said in his report , i would stress the progress made in the slovakian republic in the area of the protection of minorities . 
it should be noted , in particular , that it is permitted to use the roma language in 57 districts where the roma population exceeds 20 % . 
mr president , i voted for mr queiró 's report on the current status of hungary 's application for membership of the european union . 
the existence of serious discrimination against this community , one of the most victimised communities in europe , is a key element casting doubt over whether hungary is truly committed to making europe an area of peace , democracy and prosperity for all its constituent populations . 
van orden report ( a5 - 0241 / 2000 ) 
mr president , the pensioners ' party voted for the report on the current status of bulgaria 's application for membership of the european union . 
i welcome this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of the bulgarian republic . 
i call upon bulgaria to comply with our request . 
i welcome the martelli report on slovenia 's application for membership of the european union and endorse the conclusions she draws . 
i note that slovenia has made excellent progress towards meeting the copenhagen criteria and is making good progress towards fulfilling the acquis communautaire . 
once the european union has adjusted its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement i can see no reason why slovenia should not be welcomed into the union . 
i hope slovenia will be in the first group of new members . 
poos report ( a5 - 0249 / 2000 ) 
mr president , considering that cyprus is one of the mediterranean countries which lies in close proximity to the many central and eastern european states and that italy juts out into the mediterranean as the president of the republic , mr ciampi , recently declared in a formal sitting of the italian parliament , i am particularly pleased to note that the report emphasises the fact that cyprus ' preparations are sufficient for it to join the european union . 
i feel that this step and the entry of cyprus into the european union will prove extremely important in terms of bringing peace to this tortured island in our mediterranean . 
mr president , my vote on the report on cyprus should be seen as a protest against its lack of balance , because i am not opposed to the entry of cyprus to the european union . 
on the contrary , i am keen to see cyprus in , but i could not accept this unbalanced report , especially paragraph 4, and the failure to insist on at least on the desirability of having a political settlement prior to accession . 
in addition , the report called for the repatriation of settlers which presumably includes their children born and raised in cyprus . 
whatever the solution on settlers , and it is a thorny issue along with land restitution on both sides , this is too harsh without giving a qualification . 
the european parliament has failed in its duty to reflect a balanced approach which i very much regret . 
of course the republic of cyprus is the internationally recognised state but we should do more to recognise the rights as well as the duties of the turkish - cypriot community . 
he also noted that the un was already in contact with the eu in order to ensure that there was no clash with the goals of the united nations process . 
as mr de soto noted , we do not expect progress to be easy , and the success of the un process is far from assured . 
the uk position is that it is vital for us to do everything we can to show our support for the secretary - general 's efforts . 
unfortunately some of the comments made in the draft report on the application by cyprus for membership of the european union by the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy are not helpful . 
the use of polemical language and the one - sided impression given of meps ' views risks undermining the process . 
i therefore hope that meps will do all they can to encourage the european parliament to express its support for progress in the un settlement process , based on the continuing goodwill of all parties in that process and that they will ensure that the european parliament does not produce statements or take positions which might cut across that process . 
as a member of the delegation to the eu - cyprus joint parliamentary committee , i am pleased to have this opportunity to express my opinion on the progress cyprus has made in the negotiations for accession to the european union . 
cyprus meets all the copenhagen political and economic criteria . 
to date , 16 out of 31 chapters have been closed and the efforts of the republic of cyprus to meet all the criteria are ongoing . 
cyprus may therefore look forward to becoming a member of the european union in the near future , and any objection to this membership on the grounds of the special situation of the island would not be defensible either politically or morally . 
this is , moreover , made clear by the conclusions of the helsinki european council , which affirm , in the final analysis , that solution of the ' cyprus question ' is not a necessary precondition for accession . 
in this connection , i would hope that the talks conducted under the auspices of the united nations will be able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the greek and turkish cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages of membership of the european union in the context of a reunified republic . 
i would also like to urge that the european union , through its high representative for the cfsp , should get involved to a greater extent in seeking a negotiated solution in order to put an end to the partition of the island , in application of the united nations security council resolutions . 
the european union does have the capacity to make a key contribution to the security of the cypriot communities in the context of a peace settlement . 
it can help resolve the problem of the controlled return of refugees and the repatriation of colonists , and can make a considerable contribution to the development of the northern part of cyprus , after reunification and after the withdrawal of the turkish army . 
it is essential to initiate projects involving both communities and to encourage dialogue between both parts in a new spirit of trust . 
the european union must convince the turkish cypriot community , which comprises approximately 89 000 members , that they should get involved unconditionally in the accession talks . it is in their direct interest . 
it is therefore essential for turkish cypriots to express their point of view on the accession negotiations . 
it is not going to be an easy task , given the lack of good will on the part of the turkish cypriot side and of turkey . 
even if recent events in the region do not encourage optimism , the european union must continue to bring its weight to bear in the talks seeking an overall settlement of the cyprus question . 
. - the verts / ale group supports the report by mr poos on the accession of the republic of cyprus to the eu . 
it regrets nevertheless that its amendment on the issue of the settlers has not been adopted by the house . 
it is absolutely impossible to solve the issue of the settlers who arrived in northern cyprus from turkey a long time ago simply by sending them back , as the report suggests . 
it is unfortunate that the eu takes a one - sided position on such an acute and difficult question . 
proximity talks are not proceeding as we would have hoped . 
we are convinced that initiatives at all levels are required if to break the deadlock which have been reached in negotiations . 
we hope that the perspective of early membership of the eu and the easing of contacts by means of " bottom - up " communal projects that the eu promised to promote and finance can give a positive impetus to the solution of the " cyprus question " . 
. i warmly welcome mr poos ' report on cyprus 's application for membership of the european union . 
the maltese government should ensure that a constructive dialogue takes place with all sections of their community to ensure as wide a consensus as possible on the issue of membership . 
mr president , the wholesomeness of feed materials and feedingstuffs is , of course , very important to the pensioners ' party , and so i voted for the paulsen report . 
to be honest , i have to say that up until yesterday i did not know whether i would give an explanation of vote , but then , as i was leaving parliament yesterday evening , together with mr andria and mr speron. whose first name is francesco and who is therefore celebrating his name day today , and i wish him and all the other francescos present in this house a very happy da . i started to feel dizzy , to vomit and to be affected by other such symptoms . 
mr president , article 13 of the treaty of amsterdam has been described as a sleeping giant . 
it forms the basis for europe - wide measures to combat discrimination . 
my job was to consider the framework directive on employment and occupation , which will lead to major changes in company practice . 
the experience gained with the anti - discrimination act in the usa ten years ago gives some idea of what lies ahead for europe . 
that is why it is quite essential for the groups listed in article 13 to be effectively protected against discrimination . 
mr president , first of all , i would like to congratulate the commission on the initiative to develop article 13 of the treaty further . 
after so many years of talk , we finally have an initiative to tackle discrimination in different areas more effectively . 
i would also like to congratulate mr mann on the results of his work on the present report . 
it is a sensitive topic . 
everyone is agreed that discrimination should be fought but opinions differ as to how , to what extent and by what means . 
i applaud the recommendation of the mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind . 
the fact remains that the report tabled by our fellow member , mr cashman contains many good things , particularly the space accorded to ngos . 
i think it most important to rely on the support of this network of partners , but we must be selective in our choices and , especially , avoid being exclusive . 
in committee , i have had occasion to make a stand against the fact that there may also be experts outside ngos that have something to say . 
need i point out in this house that the principle role , particularly in terms of education , belongs to governments . 
finally , this community policy , article 13, does not lead to a situation where the solution lies necessarily in more money . 
i believe the solution lies in analysis of the use of the money , and not necessarily in making unlimited appropriations available . 
finally , we in the ppe - de group place great hope in the policy of assessment and coordination , and one of our proposals is that the fight against discrimination should give rise to a specific report to be presented before parliament , which will account for the money and the use of the community money which has been invested . 
finally , and this is my concluding remark , the definition of the causes which has been given and , indeed , adopted in the charter which we shall have to adopt in november , is an acceptable one , making it possible to resolve a great many tensions within the european union . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if tomorrow , the entire house adopts the viewpoints held by the competent committees with regard to the directive , i am convinced that the new directive on equal treatment in the workplace will be an excellent directive , which will have an enormous impact on the elderly , the disabled , homosexuals and lesbians in their battle against discrimination in the workplace . 
my group therefore lends its unqualified support to the report and we would particularly like to thank the co - rapporteurs , mr thomas mann and mrs joke swiebel for their sterling work and also congratulate them on the excellent cooperation within the respective committees . 
i would , in fact , like to seize the opportunity also to congratulate mr cashman , because although directives are important , action programmes are , of course , essential too in terms of the support they lend to directives . 
the speed with which the institutions have deployed the new amsterdam powers , commissioner , show that the european union is still in the vanguard of equal opportunities , and i would like to extend my express thanks to the european commission for this . 
moreover , i hope that the french presidency will be indulged and that this directive and the action programme will now be approved . 
i would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group . 
parliament rightly chose to play the trump cards which we already have in the form of existing directives on equal treatment , those on gender and those on race and ethnic origin , and i am particularly pleased with the sound descriptions of indirect discrimination , positive action and the principle of shared burden of proof . 
legal provisions are an important component , but cannot be the only one , in the fight against discrimination . 
the community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented . 
so we must support grassroots initiatives , improve information about discrimination and underpin the political programmes . 
only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life . 
that has to be in the interest of all of us ! 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i feel that this action plan is a major step forward in the fight against discrimination , partly because , in these so very complex times , in the highly complex societies we live in , discrimination takes many other forms which are ever more unexpected and give ever greater cause for concern 
i would like to focus on one point of the action plan which , as i said in committee , i feel leaves large gaps : the inclusion of turkey . 
it is not that turkey should not be included in this action plan , but we are financing a stat. which i may define as crimina. without any insistence at all that these funds should be used to eradicate the worst form of discrimination , namely discrimination against the kurdish - speaking turkish citizens . 
therefore , we are providing funds for turkey to use as it likes without any obligation to eliminate the worst form of discrimination , which is a combination of all forms of discrimination in that , if there is discrimination against kurds in general now , discrimination against kurdish women , people of kurdish origin with deviant sexual tendencies and disabled people of kurdish origin will soon follow . 
we have proposed a number of amendments to the mann report , amendments which make some of the points referred to more democratic and more liberal and ensure that they advocate civil liberties . the amendments remove the reversal of the burden of proof , the involvement of employers ' associations in dialogue between the two sides of industry and limit sanctions to civil and administrative penalties , not criminal penalties . 
ladies and gentlemen , i would remind you that whenever prohibition has been applied in europe it has been necessary to take a step backwards . 
a sensitive issue is the clash with other constitutional rights , such as freedom of religion and belief , and the right to respect for privacy . 
i have a feeling that these rights are being infringed upon by article 4 of the commission proposal and the amendment tabled in this respect by the committee on employment and social affairs . 
religion and belief are not separate entities . 
this is why organisations , schools and nursing homes which express a particular identity have been established by and for people who share the same belief . 
managerial and executive staff will give corporate shape to this belief . 
absolute freedom of religion is impossible , as is absolute equality . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all glad that there is an article 13 in the treaty of amsterdam because it finally puts an instrument in our hands and gives us the task of creating a comprehensive programme to combat discrimination . 
the commission has submitted an action plan until the year 2006 . 
it is very ambitious , highly committed and very concrete in terms of its objective , actions and individual measures . 
my second point is the problem that ngos , important as they may be , are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size , nature and activities . 
over and above this , they are also being asked to be responsible for monitoring ; and if the ngos are core funded up to 90 % by the union , the problem is compounded if the ngos monitor themselves . 
i do not think we should ask too much of anybody . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this week is an important week as far as the debates in this house are concerned . 
yesterday , we discussed the charter of fundamental rights , and today , in discussing community initiatives , we are debating the matter of combating discrimination . 
we are thereby boosting the positions of the european union regarding the practical situations experienced by european nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment . 
let us beware , nonetheless , lest these statistics be used against the men and women they concern . 
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party has assessed all this with positive results , particularly focusing on the activity of parliament , which insisted , in addition and above all , on preventive action as well as good practice . 
we felt that the objectives relating to enhancing in - depth understanding of the issue and its new forms , scale and development and , most importantly , action supporting those who have to implement these good practices , were entirely convincing . 
yet we were even more impressed by fact that , at the end of the report , provision was made for an evaluation of the outcome of the processes and programmes , for this is also a guarantee of fairness , impartiality and transparency . 
i would especially like to focus on the opportunities provided for the member states , who have to concentrate on high - quality actions , to work autonomously . 
this means that , for the first time , a different line is being adopted : we are not doling out funding left , right and centre but evaluating the quality of the operations and insisting on high quality ; the operations themselves must then be monitored and their results published . 
in france , for example , men are not allowed to teach in primary education . that is a case of blatant discrimination . 
the question is , however , far more significant in philosophical , legal and sociological terms . 
legally speaking , there are general texts condemning discrimination everywhere . 
yesterday , for example , the charter of fundamental rights condemned discrimination , not just racial discrimination but even , according to the charter , discrimination on the basis of birth . 
in affirming the principle of equality , all the constitutions of the world virtually establish a principle of constitutional jus cogens , since discrimination is prohibited everywhere . 
on the other hand , however , for forty years there have been texts in existence which are actually based on discrimination . 
in geneva in 1963, the first of these , unctad , united nations conference on trade and development , established the principle of compensatory inequalities or , in other words , discrimination . 
i just wonder how much in fact we have learned and how wiser we have become as a result of the events in the balkans , which were primarily caused by religious fanaticism . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as is well known , many forms of discrimination still remain in the european union , specifically in employment and professional activities , even though they are prohibited under article 13 of the eu treaty . 
it is therefore important to press forward with the two legislative initiatives that are now being debated , while improving them in certain respects and increasing the funds set aside for financing the programme , thus reflecting the political importance of this fight against discrimination . 
it is not enough for equality to be guaranteed in law . 
this is also true for homosexuals . 
so those who claim here that europe does not need to lay down in a directive the values which we all aim to defend are mistaken . 
we do need this to happen and we must give out this signal to the outside world . 
belgium is holding local elections on sunday . 
we have agreed with all democratic parties that we will be forming a cordon sanitaire against the extreme right . 
this means that none of these parties will form a coalition with the extreme right . 
this is an extremely important decision and we feel supported by directives such as these , which is of great importance . 
commissioner , i should like you to carry on undeterred , as we desperately need this decision . 
mr president , there is no hierarchy of discrimination . 
i welcome this directive as the first - ever eu law introducing europe - wide rights for our 37 million disabled citizens , an end to the back - door route to legislate for disability rights and a tribute to the disability movement which has campaigned for this day . 
in particular the agreement of the principle of reasonable accommodation , pioneered in sweden and ireland , will now ensure that employers across europe adapt their workplaces , acquire specialist equipment and amend their working practices so that disabled employees really do get a fair chance . 
it might simply mean lowering a light switch by a metre but , for the wheelchair user it makes the difference between a job or no job . 
i thank mr mann for his support on this point . 
i also thank my colleague , mr cashman , for accepting my amendments on the action programme which will guarantee european money to cover the extra cost of disability , to promise information accessible to all , and to ensure that disabled people can speak for themselves . 
two more messages . 
firstly , to all meps , remember that we achieved a strong directive combating race discrimination , for which i was proud to act as co - rapporteur , with action against incitement , for the right to go to court , to empower ngos , to shift the burden of proof . 
do not meddle with these hard - won gains . 
secondly , to the commissioner , i know you will not today be able to accept my amendment no 56 on procurement , but in your reply i ask you to promise this house that you will bring forward new legislation to link the power of the public purse to companies ' compliance with these laws . 
please also tell us that it was a mistake for the commission to propose core funding for only one european ngo representing each discriminated group . 
this legislation is about valuing diversity . 
do not ignore your own words by denying deaf people , people with learning difficulties , and self - managed organisations of disabled people the possibility even to sit at the table . 
mr president , if one thing singles out european society from the other societies of the world , it is precisely its sensitivity and commitment to the fight for freedom and human rights . 
however , i would like to say that this fight is not the exclusive property of the left . 
sometimes , with cheap demagoguery and a progressivism which it cannot even define , the left tries to confuse the public with hypotheses which sometimes lack any content and are sometimes inadequate for the task of structuring society in accordance with certain values which our group will always champion . 
that is what differentiates some benches from others . 
article 13 is the starting point for a new eu objective : to combat discrimination or inequality in the treatment of citizens for the reasons listed therein . 
the action programme seems to me to be a serious programme . 
it is almost acceptable in its original form because , essentially , it is directed at something fundamental , that is , educating european society in the value of the human being , of whatever type . 
i believe that this is the central nucleus of the programme . 
i therefore consider that it is necessary to commit the public and private sectors to this task and , to this end , i believe that the public sector must provide an example . 
public administrations and schools must be a model in the fight against discrimination and the same must be required , naturally to an equal extent , of the private sector . 
finally , ladies and gentlemen , the media must also play an important role in this task . 
unfortunately today , certain sections of the media , such as television and the internet , do not contribute through their programmes and advertisements to the dignified and respectful treatment of the sectors of society who most need that cooperation , such as , for example , women and children . 
the objective of also increasing the awareness of the media with regard to this task therefore seems to me to be a very good one . 
mr president , i should like first of all to say thank you to mr cashman and mr mann for the two reports . 
it is incredibly important that we should now secure implementation of the package which is the first and interim realisation of article 13 of the ec treaty . 
mr president , i should like to underline what my colleague mr hernández mollar has just said . 
this fight against discrimination is a fight that mobilises us all and it cannot be an exclusive banner for any political group in this parliament . 
it is crucial that we teach and promote respect for multicultural diversity in europe . 
i should also like to stress the importance of involving the countries applying for membership as much as we can in these community actions to combat discrimination . 
a spiritual dimension is vital to europe . 
we must avoid absurd tangles of red tape , which will only succeed in reducing europe to a purely materialistic , politically correct but pointless entity . 
ladies and gentlemen , at the time of the discussions regarding the treaty of amsterdam , we were delighted , myself in particular , at the inclusion of article 13 on discrimination on the basis of sex , race or ethnic origin , religion or philosophical conviction. non sectarian , i might ad. handicap in any form , age or sexual orientation . 
this was , moreover , the basis for proposed measures to combat discrimination . 
these proposals involve two draft directives and one action programme intended to support the efforts of the member states . 
it is extremely difficult , of course , both for me and for my fellow members , to give a precise opinion on measures of such great significance in just two minutes . 
as regards the mann report on equal treatment in employment , and let me congratulate the rapporteur , i shall confine myself to pointing out that i am , personally , satisfied that it has been possible to reduce the number of permissible exemptions to a minimum . 
some possibilities have been retained , however , which i must admit i find somewhat shocking . 
one such is the possibility of derogation on terms of religion . 
the provision according to which the notion of professional , essential and crucial requirement may justify exemptions on the grounds of religion is not , in my view , acceptable . 
as a confirmed secularist , i could not possibly endorse it . 
i would now like to make a request to the commissioner . 
commissioner , the inquiry has been followed up by a fiche d ' impact . 
in my view , this fiche d ' impac. and i am involved a great deal with small and medium - sized businesses in this parliamen. is one big scandal . 
it amounts to one official having spent one afternoon behind a desk dreaming up all kinds of positive effects which in no way tally with reality . 
because organisations are important in this process , i hope that the amendment which i tabled , to the effect that more than one organisation should have a share of the grants , and which was adopted by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs will also be that amendment which is finally adopted . 
as you know , last november the commission proposed a broad package based on article 13 with two directives and a programme . 
one of the directives has already been adopted in record time , and i am quite optimistic that the other one will be adopted during the french presidency in november . 
the debate in parliament was extremely interesting , and you have already highlighted the political importance of this directive . 
in particular i welcome the amendments you have made on mainstreaming and on the issue of multiple discrimination . 
i will also accept the amendments you have tabled to bring out the importance of preventing discrimination , as well as combating it . 
i welcome your reference to this question in amendment no 37 . 
i can also agree to the idea of extending the wording of article 4 ( 2 ) to include organisations providing services in a religious environment , as we realise that the wording of the commission 's proposal was very rigid . 
in my view , with these two additions , the scope of the proposal becomes clear . 
on the contrary , i cannot accept amendment no 38 which proposes to delete from article 5 the list of differences of treatment on grounds of age , which could be justified . 
this is not in line with our proposal . 
the commission 's intention is to create workable rules for companies while at the same time prohibiting instances of discrimination which are arbitrary and not objectively justified . 
however , i understand that this is a very sensitive issue . 
the commission is ready to simplify the wording of article 5 for better understanding of this provision . 
regarding the second category of amendments , it aims to clarify the text of the commission 's proposal . 
in particular , amendments nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin . 
all three can be accepted for reasons of legal consistency . 
i also accept the references to the 2000 employment strategy , to personal and self - realisation , to discrimination as an obstacle to free movement of persons , to the clarification of the personal scope of the directive as being applicable to third country nationals , to the clarification of the burden of proof and to the simplification of the information provision . 
these references are contained in amendments nos 7, 8, 9, 12, 34 and 47 . 
the commission can accept the spirit of all these amendments . 
i want to turn now to the third category of amendments . 
i can accept the spirit behind all these amendments but in some cases there is a problem with the wording . 
however , there are a number of other amendments which i cannot accept , either for technical reasons or because their detailed nature runs counter to the purpose of the framework directive . 
i would like to refer in detail to those amendments which i cannot accept because they present political or legal difficulties . 
you have addressed the important question of contract compliance . 
this kind of provision is not appropriate in a directive on a framework proposal . 
i agree that it is very important and i pledge that it will be a communication : we will examine this in the text of the communication we have already announced in the social agenda . 
in conclusion , some members of parliament referred to the need for cooperation about , or the implementation of , directives like these in the applicant countries . 
this directive must be part of the social acquis in the applicant countries . 
it is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme . 
applicant countries can cooperate with the member states and submit joint projects and joint proposals and this is very important for them and for us also . 
some of the members have referred to the particular problems that turkey has with the kurdish language and the problems in turkey . 
i consider that the community could support and select any kind of project that the turkish government submitted in the framework of this action plan . 
i had to reply to more than 50 different points and amendments and i am very optimistic that these amendments will be adopted during the french presidency . 
that concludes the debate . 
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon . 
arms trade code of conduct 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0211 / 2000 ) by mr titley , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the council 's 1999 annual report on the implementation of the eu code of conduct on arms exports ( 11384 / 199 . 
c5 ­ 0021 / 200 . 
2000 / 2012 ( cos ) ) 
mr president , it may have passed some people by , but the fact that i am able to stand here and lead a debate on the council 's annual report on arms exports is really quite sensational , firstly because for years this parliament called for a code of conduct in arms exports and was told it was an impossible dream . 
yet we have a code , thanks largely to the initiative of the british foreign secretary , robin cook , proof once again that where parliament leads today , the council will eventually follow . 
secondly , when the code was agreed cynics said it was too weak and it would not work . 
yet it is clear from the annual report that it has worked better than all expectations , including those of the member state governments who approached this project with great suspicion . 
the code of conduct has led to greater mutual understanding , greater transparency and a greater convergence of member states ' policies . 
furthermore non - eu countries are queuing up to associate themselves with the code . 
effective and coherent eu policy on arms exports is essential if the eu is to pursue its external objectives , particularly given that we have so many areas of instability on our borders . 
you cannot claim to respect democracy and human rights if you do not act to stop weapons of murder and repression falling into the wrong hands . 
you cannot seriously pursue conflict prevention and peacemaking without controlling arms exports , particularly small arms . 
you cannot expect public support for peacemaking operations if our troops face death from weapons which we have ourselves supplied . 
at the same time the european defence industries remain strategically and economically important to the eu . 
in order to survive they need to continue their consolidation and rationalisation . 
a common arms exports policy is essential to this process . 
that is why the framework agreement signed by the six member states in july was so important . 
despite the enormous progress made , there are areas where the code of conduct needs to be strengthened . 
article 7 of the code commits member states to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users . 
yet end user regulations vary enormously from country to country . 
they should be better coordinated and more effective . 
as a starting point we need a community - wide database of information on licences and sensitive end users . 
it is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers . 
yet most countries have little , if any , control over them . 
in my own country i would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed . 
this is wrong and i welcome the british government 's announcement last week that it is to stop . 
mr president , i have to confess to a certain nostalgia for the times when the european parliamen. and the various pacifist movements and trade union. used to call urgently for dedication and action in order to steadily reduce arms manufacturing , and we would discuss ways of converting military production into civilian production . 
i still feel that this must be our approach , that we must not give in before the inevitability of war and conflict and that the defence policy must not provide for large - scale arms production , but that europe must adopt an defence policy of intervention where it is not weapons that count but the ability to intervene peacefully in order to find non - violent solutions to disputes . 
that said , since i am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground , i will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation . 
i feel that it is important , as stated in the opinion of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy itself , which is attached to the report , that the code of conduc. and we can deduce this from the annual report which we examine. has led to steps forward in the area of controlling and rationalising arms exports from the european union . 
i would like to emphasise certain points which appear to be particularly important : making the code of conduct legally binding , actively working towards drawing up an international code of conduct on the transfer of arms , making implementation of the code of conduct more transparen. in order to better assess its effectivenes. for example , providing information relating to the number and type of weapons for which licences have been granted and to the identity of exporting countries and countries of destination , conducting checks on intermediaries and brokers , putting an end to the current practice of selling european union arms in areas of war or where human rights are blatantly violated . 
another major point is the ban on exporting , promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is , in practice , to be used for the purposes of torture . 
there are a great many other important points , but i would just like to end by saying that transparency dictates a greater involvement of national parliaments at decision - making level and the participation of ngos . 
mr president , commissioner , in taking the floor on the extremely difficult subject of arms sales , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the manner in which he has managed to clarify matters for parliament in the outstanding and comprehensive explanatory statement in the motion for a resolution which is being discussed today and which will be voted on tomorrow in this house . 
mr president , this parliament has always argued in favour of improving eu laws on arms export and , partly as a result of these pleas , we now have a code of conduct which we are able to debate today for the first time . 
the pse group sees this as a good start but a code is no law . 
we continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date , in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry . 
i hope that the bigger players in the arms export industry can see this as well . 
may the improved cooperation between six member states , which came about recently , serve as a case in point . 
i would still like to underline that , within that framework , one of our objectives is to improve the so - called end - user regulation . 
we feel we should continue to work on this code and ensure that it can lead to a common arms export policy in due course . 
the rapporteur is also right to highlight a number of persistent problems in the field of arms export . 
the proliferation of light weapons remains disconcerting , even close to home , in the balkans , for example . 
mr president , its undeniable merits notwithstanding , the report is very technical and sticks to the paradigm and framework of military security , and it lends disproportionate weight to considerations relating to the defence industry . 
there are only faint rumblings in the background when it comes to armed conflicts and human suffering . 
we must extend our study , on the one hand , not only to matters of binding agreements , but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes , voluntary disarmament , conversion , and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective , and , on the other hand , the applicant countries just mentioned by mr wiersma . 
the code of conduct , as part of a common foreign and security policy , will also be binding on the applicant countries . 
we would also like the important nato country , turkey , which is also an important market , to be mentioned in this connection . 
it is only by complementary action such as this that we can move towards a more sustainable security in europe and the world , one that is founded on disarmament and stability . 
i shall here simply discuss a quite special issue concerning the draft resolution . 
our aim must be coherence and that i take to be a very important underlying message in the report . 
the eu code of conduct establishes a set of detailed principles governing conventional arms exports . 
these aim at preventing the export of weapons to governments which abuse human rights , to areas of conflict or to regions engaged in arms races . 
it is clear that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments . 
but the arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy , with which of course the commission is fully associated . 
the code has been in existence for one year and , as acknowledged in the first annual report , member states ' initial experiences of its operation during this period were positive . 
the code has already increased mutual understanding of member states ' policies , it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and it has encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions . 
it is undeniable , however , that there are grounds for further strengthening of the code and its implementation , as mr titley has mentioned . 
the aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements . 
any amendments to the code must enjoy the support of all member states . 
in this respect we welcome the adoption of a common list of military equipment covered by the code during the portuguese presidency , as requested by this report . 
the commission services are currently exploring the possibilities of drafting ec legislation on non - military items to which the provisions of the code should apply . 
this would certainly include instruments which can be used for torture and other cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment . 
the commission services , in the course of their regular meetings with associated countries , continue to encourage them to abide by the code 's provisions and fully implement its criteria and to monitor their compliance . 
furthermore , the european union is interested in broadening the acceptance of the main principles contained in the code so as to cover the world 's main arms exporters . 
the european union is committed to combating the destabilising accumulation of small arms in many parts of the world . 
the commission , in close collaboration with the member states , was actively involved in the drafting of the european union joint action on small arms and light weapons . 
we fully intend to strengthen policy in this area as part of a coherent approach . 
we agree with the rapporteur that further efforts are needed in establishing common rules for controlling the legal trade and for eradicating trafficking and smuggling in such arms . 
we are committed to providing financial and technical assistance to countries , international organisations , regional arrangements and ngos , as proposed by the joint action . 
a number of projects are currently in progress or under consideration . 
under the eu project in cambodia , technical , administrative and financial support is provided to the government and to selected ngos for actions aimed at promoting the control , collection and destruction of weapons . 
the european union is currently considering the continuation of the project beyond its expiry date in november of this year . 
we are also supporting operation rachel , a joint south africa / mozambique operation , on the collection and destruction of small arms . 
other projects are under consideration in south ossetia and west africa . 
the commission attaches great importance to the 2001 un conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons . 
european research area 
the next item is the commission communication on the european research area . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , today the commission adopted a communication that is important for the future of research in europe . 
it proposes guidelines for future union research activities , for the period 2002 - 2006, and more especially for the union 's future research framework programme . 
the aim is to define the specific contribution that this will make to the creation of a european research area . 
by means of its resolution of 18 may 2000, this parliament lent its firm support to this project , which is now being put into action . 
a group of representatives from the member states has therefore been set up to deal with the issues of benchmarking and the mapping of excellence , and this group is currently working with the commission . 
a methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next research council . 
the initial results will be presented to the european council meeting scheduled for next march , which aims to address general economic and social issues . 
but it is clear that the union 's research framework programme also has a more specific role to play . 
before it can do so , however , there is a need for a comprehensive review of its design , the conditions under which it is implemented and , more specifically , its methods of intervention . 
the guidelines set out in the communication adopted this morning have been defined with this in mind , on the basis , in particular , of the conclusions of the report on the five - year assessment of research programmes , drawn up by a panel of independent experts , and the mid - term review of the fifth research framework programme , carried out by the commission . 
the guidelines have been defined in such a way as to enable european research to be structured more efficiently via the european union 's research programme . 
they are based on the following principles : a switch from an approach centred on individual research projects to a broader approach , based on a set of cohesive actions of which european union measures will constitute but a part . 
mr president , commissioner , in your communication on the european research area you also referred to the poor mobility of researchers and to the problems within europe . 
hence my question : do you intend to follow up this communication on the european research area with legislative initiatives , with a view , for instance , to improving mobility as well as social protection during periods spent abroad ? 
mr president , i would like to respond succinctly to the various members who have spoken , by saying that i hope that next thursday 's debate will be more in - depth . 
first of all , i would like to reply to mrs mcnally : the issue of european added value formed part of the criteria for calls for proposals , which already comprised a series of elements such as , for example , the multinational dimension , the fact that there are several member states , the fact of these being projects which were more or less european in scale . 
these were therefore elements which already existed . 
but to date there had not necessarily been any form of ranking or factors dictating exclusion . 
with regard to the actions that we propose , page 16 of the policy paper sets out the new ways in which we are thinking of working , with greater decentralisation towards associations and towards national structures . 
lastly , as concerns mobility , mr linkohr , you will be aware of just how much this issue , and all its social implications , is of concern to us . 
the mobility group has been set up at commission level , with the various member states , and is to hold its first meeting on 20 october . 
this group consists of the representatives of research ministers , but also actual ministers for social affairs and home affairs , to overcome obstacles to mobility , such as problems concerning pensions and freedom of movement on european territory . 
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his introduction but i am still left with a few questions . 
meetings have been held with the greek , irish and portuguese authorities to ask the governments of these countries to speed up their presentation to the commission of their cohesion fund projects . 
i have to report not only to the court of auditors and to the tax - payers , but also , first and foremost , to the european parliament , which is responsible for budgetary control and for adopting this budget , and i believe that it is my duty and role to say what is happening , at such times as i judge fit , and to do so in a transparent manner , with respect for the budgetary authority of which the european parliament forms part . 
there are reasons why so few projects have been submitted to the commission to date . 
on the one hand , as a result of the efforts made to commit all the appropriations at the end of 1999, there was inevitably a very sharp drop in applications for the financing of new projects at the beginning of this financial year . 
on the other hand , as this is the first year of the new programming period , i have to say , and this is an objective assessment , that the cohesion fund countries , including your own , have centred their efforts on objective 1 programming . 
i have , in fact , publicly stated , notably at lisbon in the presence of the prime minister and mrs lisa ferreira , that the commission was extremely satisfied with the quality of the work carried out by the portuguese authorities in conjunction with the local authorities as concerns objective 1 programming . 
however , due to the very major efforts made it has been impossible to make a simultaneous and commensurate effort in respect of the cohesion fund . 
indeed , contrary to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on the structural funds , no form of rebudgeting in subsequent financial years is provided for in the case of the cohesion fund . 
those countries that are cohesion fund beneficiaries should therefore be under no illusion that there is little time left for projects to be submitted and appraised under the budget year in progress . 
that is the point that i wanted to make as clearly as possible , mrs torres marques . thank you for providing me with the possibility to do so . 
many thanks , mr barnier , for coming on behalf of the commission to answer this question , which is very important to us . 
but i think , mr barnie. and i am sorry to say thi. you are not very well informed . 
perhaps the lack of staff you have just mentioned exclusively devoted to the cohesion fun. who did exist in the former commissio. prevented you from having more concrete details . 
commissioner , i would like to ask you two things . 
the question raised by the honourable member is extremely topical but , in order to be able to give a clear answer , i have to remind you of the origin of community law on fuel tax . 
in 1987, the commission submitted several proposals on indirect taxation in order to abolish the fiscal borders as part of completing the internal market . 
regarding duty , the aim of the commission was to achieve complete harmonisation of taxation on mineral oils within the community by introducing a unique duty for each type of product . 
had these measures met with approval , unfair competition , as intimated by the honourable member today , would almost certainly have been ruled out . 
however , this proposal instead met with heavy protest from certain member states . 
in 1989, the commission submitted a new proposal which was to offer more flexibility . 
that proposal which , in addition to minimum rates , also provided for narrow rate bands and target rates , was once again rejected by the member states . 
eventually , in 1992, the member states unanimously decided on the introduction of a community system of tax levies on mineral oils which only provided for a minimum tax rate for each type of mineral oil on the basis of its use ; i.e. as fuel for motor vehicles , for industrial and commercial use or for heating . 
i would thus like to underline that the community minimum rates have not been reviewed since 1992 and that today , in practice , duty levels often far exceed the community minimum rates and also differ greatly from country to country . 
as the honourable member pointed out , the duty on fuel and diesel used as motor fuel which applies in the united kingdom is the highest in europe , but duties on fuel oil and kerosene , at least i. and insofar a. these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or even for heating , remain far below the highest values applicable within the union , as is also the case with the duty on heavy fuel oil . 
it is thus a mixed bag and it is not the case that all duties on mineral oils are higher in the united kingdom than elsewhere in europe . 
finally , if duties on mineral oils are laid down at a high level , this does not lead to non - compliance with community regulations in terms of competition . 
government aid , on the other hand , could exist , as a form of government aid , only if certain specific sectors were to enjoy exemptions from general regulations , and the compatibility or otherwise of such aid measures with the treaty would then have to be examined . 
this concludes my response for the time being . 
mr president , i am grateful to mr bolkestein for his very careful answer to my question , but i am not quite sure that he has answered it fully . 
to make matters clear , as the commission will know , this question was tabled before the protests began and it was prompted by complaints from people in my constituency . 
for example , there is a company on the island of north uist which is engaged in quarrying and road maintenance . 
it seems a very good idea that there should be small - and medium - sized enterprises that are able to tender for and compete for road maintenance work on islands of that kind . 
it is good for employment and for social cohesion . 
i appreciate the points mr bolkestein made and i know that the principal rule in the treaties prohibits charging foreigners more than home companies , but the general law of fair competition in europe ought to apply and where levels of taxation are totally disproportionate we should look at the effect competition law can have on the situation , despite the general rule that these matters are the prerogative of member states . 
mr president , i would say to mr maccormick that the commission has no means of influencing the level of excise taxes for mineral oil products in member states . 
i want to be clear and insist on this point , because , as i said in my answer in the first instance , the commission has made several attempts to get member states to agree to the harmonisation of excise taxes precisely to avoid distortions in trade which may arise as a result of the differences therein . 
if , therefore , mr martin bears in mind that if we want to attain the aims and purposes of the kyoto agreement and a high price of oil to the consumer would be beneficial to that end , then he has the logic of economic reasoning behind him . 
mr president , i accept the commissioner 's very balanced arguments about kyoto and the economic repercussions thereof but we are talking here about particular problems in peripheral and remote areas . 
if the commission has no instruments to influence levels of excise taxes in member states , and if favouring certain industries is not allowed under the competition rules , surely where a region suffers special disadvantages because of peripherality and remoteness , it would only be a case of equalising matters , not of giving any special preference if there was some differential in excise taxes permitted in those special and particular circumstances ? 
i should like to say to mr purvis that the matter of natural , regional disadvantages is probably a matter for the national governments since a part of their electorate lies in those outlying areas and peripheral regions . 
they may also fall under the competence of my colleague , mr barnier , who spoke to this assembly a little while ago . 
from my point of view , i look after the fiscal matters of the union , insofar as i am allowed to do so by the member states . 
it would not be right if i said that a geographical advantage were to be achieved by fiscal means so , to that extent , i must disappoint mr purvis . 
however , if he comes to me with a particular case in point , a particular region , or whatever if may be , then i would be happy to raise the matter with my colleague , mr barnier . 
question no 3 by ( h - 0743 / 00 ) : 
subject : budget line for minority languagesthe budget line of the european union for minority languages was introduced in 1983 and increased steadily to reach a peak in 1995 with eur 4 million . 
since then the appropriations have been cut , for no apparent reason , with the result that in the current year they amount to eur 3.5 million . 
this is all the more surprising in that the european union is moving closer towards enlargement to the east and the question of minorities is becoming increasingly important as a result , particularly in the context of a proper exchange of information . 
dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward , but we must be able to prepare these minorities . 
would it be possible to fund that through the pre - accession programmes and the structural funds ? 
mr president , i am sure my parliamentary colleagues know that the structural fund. and this is something ne. earmark very substantial funds for cultural activities , for both i and michel barnier considered it important to ensure that the structural funds do not invest only in roads and airports but also in people . 
but the fact is that applications to the structural funds have to come not from the commission or the european parliament , but from the governments . 
i should like to thank commissioner liikanen for that answer , even though i am not entirely happy with it for obvious reasons . 
i have also spoken with her . 
where concrete financing proposals are concerned , it is not possible for me to adopt a position here , because we must respect the normal procedures . 
as i said , i have asked my officials to find a solution which would enable us to use the current budget grant , that is to say the money we budgeted for the year 2000 . 
i nonetheless believe that we have to find a partner who operates internationally . 
thirdly , each presidency must clearly have its own programme . 
if such a situation were to arise , we should have to discuss it later . 
it is obviously a good thing if the commission has re - thought this issue . 
it would be devastating if support for the work on combating child sex tourism were to be withdrawn . 
every year , more than one million children are forced into prostitution . 
these children are increasingly exploited by tourists and businessmen who , remarkably often , come from europe . 
research shows that the creation of the single currency entails significant overall economic benefits . 
that is why the introduction of the euro should be seen as an investment rather than a cost for the economic operators involved . 
research on the potential changeover costs for individual undertakings would only provide a partial view and could be misleading . 
as regards compensation , the member states and the commission take the view that the public authorities and the private economic operators will each bear the costs of the changeover in their respective fields . 
the commission believes that all undertakings will be able to prepare themselves in time for the final changeover to the euro , including the adaptation of their computer systems and software . 
however , the present state of preparation is a matter for concern . 
indeed many smes are still not fully aware of the implications of the changeover for their businesses , particularly as regards the legal tax and accounting rules and their software . 
the commission and member states are currently stepping up their efforts to provide information to remedy this situation . 
i would like to thank the commissioner , who spoke succinctly yet unequivocally on the issue . 
if they cannot , although they may reap benefits later on , the result will be that they may close down , as we were told during a seminar that was held in brussels three months ago . 
this must be addressed , as we are talking of millions of smes throughout europe . 
since the commissioner doubts whether sufficient progress has been made in respect of information and preparation , i would also like to ask whether he has any statistics on what percentage of the changeover has been completed in sme. let us stick with the. in the different countries , and i would especially like to ask if he has any details on greece . 
this philosophical political discussion is no longer on the agenda , but in general we can discuss the dangers of a referendum , but perhaps in some other context . 
during the mission referred to , carried out in france in november 1999, it was found that the route plans stamped by the competent authorities of the place of departure were not properly implemented and that travelling time limits were often exceeded . 
the fvo mission report mentioned refers specifically to transporters whose journeys originated in ireland . 
concerning france , the commission is waiting to be informed about the actions taken by the competent authorities regarding some of the recommendations of the fvo mission report , especially of the action taken to ensure that route plans are properly used and signed . 
a reminder has been recently sent to the french authorities . 
irish authorities have been informed of the findings of the fvo and details of the deficiencies detected have been sent . 
the commission is currently monitoring the situation in both cases . 
if it appears that a member state repeatedly fails to enforce community legislation , the commission would consider opening an infringement procedure under article 226, as has already been initiated against other member states in relation to the protection of animals during transport . 
i will present a report on the implementation in the member states of the community legislation on the protection of animals during transport to the council and to the european parliament . 
the commission 's report will include the findings mentioned in the fvo inspection reports . 
when this report has been concluded , i intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of insufficient enforcement of the travelling time limits will be addressed . 
in conclusion , i assure you that animal welfare is very high on the commission 's agenda . 
i look forward to further discussion of these issues when i present the report on animal transport in the next few weeks . 
. as i indicated , the commission is currently working on a report on the operation of an animal transport directive in the member states . 
this report is at an advanced stage of preparation and will , i hope , lead to further proposals for improvement in the existing situation , in particular in the existing directive . 
we discussed this issue previously at my meeting with the green group . 
the standing committee on seeds and propagating material for agriculture , horticulture and forestry has discussed a plan for coordinated and harmonised interim action in respect of gm seed impurities in seed of conventional varieties . 
under this plan the member states would immediately organise testing of a significant number of seed lots of conventional varieties to determine the presence of gm seeds until the coming into force of related new community legislative measures . 
this is a practical measure which you could introduce immediately . 
i am pleased to report the standing veterinary committee responsible for seeds held a number of meetings in june , july and september on this particular issue with a view to reaching an interim agreement between member states as to how to deal with this kind of situation , pending the enactment of the legislation that i referred to . 
this is a matter which , strictly speaking , falls largely within the competence of my colleague , mr liikanen . 
however , having consulted with his services , i am in a position to inform you that essential safety requirements concerning computer equipment to be used privately or in the working place are prescribed by a directive relating to electrical products , the low voltage directive , as well as by the directive on radio equipment and telecommunication terminals . 
specific standards have been developed by standardisation bodies on a number of these safety aspects . 
there are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the directive on the safety in the workplace but none yet for private use . 
moreover , the council recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the public to electro - magnetic fields is applicable to safety aspects of computer equipment . 
concerning these aspects , the commission has already prepared a mandate for the standardisation bodies to draft standards on the use of computers over long periods . 
as far as advice to be given to parents and teachers , whose children and pupils use computers , is concerned , manufacturers are obliged , under the present legislation to provide an instruction for safe use of the equipment if deemed necessary . 
the general product safety also puts an obligation on producers to provide consumers with information on risks . 
this autumn the commission will ask cenelec to consider the development of standards on the effect on eyes of display units and computer screens for private use , as well as the inclusion of information and warnings for parents and teachers on this aspect . 
ergonomic aspects will also be assessed to find if action at community level is needed . 
at this stage the commission does not consider that a specific directive is required to cover the issue of warnings for parents identified by the honourable member . 
standardisation can meet the concerns expressed . 
this is the same approach which has been followed to address , for example , the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled in relation to information and communication technologies . 
for the more general question on the follow - up by member states to the council resolution on operating instructions for technical consumer goods , it should be noted that this resolution is addressed to member states and to the economic operators and does not involve any specific follow - up by the commission . 
however , the commission will ask the member states to provide information on the follow - up given the resolution . 
what will the commission do in this case ? 
i am delighted to say that i agree with you mr president , and agree with the honourable member . 
the record of the burmese regime remains appalling . 
like members of this house and decent civilised people the world over , the commission deplores the continued violation of human rights by the military regime in burma , in particular the extra - judicial killings , the widespread imposition of forced labour and forced displacement of local populations , as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties . 
the regime 's treatment of the nobel laureate , aung san suu kyi , is all of a piece with their treatment of the burmese people . 
the dignity and courage with which she responds is an inspiration to all of us and a symbol of hope to the people of burma of a brighter future . 
as for further declaratory political action , i am always prepared to consider the case for that . 
this is where the whole question of whether or not it is worth engaging in a dialogue is one that has to think about very carefully . 
for example , if we were to send a commission still to rangoon we would only conceivably consider doing so if there was a guarantee that a delegation could meet with aung san suu kyi , if there was a guarantee that it could meet with her party colleagues , if there was a guarantee that it could also meet with the ethnic minority leaders . 
i was very glad that the commissioner mentioned the ethnic minority groups and the need to open a dialogue with them . 
in practical terms can he tell us what , if anything , the european union can do about a policy which has been virtually one of genocide over many years towards the karen , shan , and other minority groups ? 
mr president , apart from the political measures that we have already discussed , the most practical thing we can try to do is to provide some humanitarian assistance . 
we have been trying to do that through ngos . 
there are many living in wretched conditions outside the country in refugee camps and others living in wretched conditions within the country . 
i hope that we will be able to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to them , but obviously what is most importan. this would encourage them to return from bangladesh and from other countries in the regio. what is most important is that there should be a political settlement which recognises those rights as well as the rights of those who were democratically elected over ten years ago and whose election was swept aside by the generals . 
we have provided from the commission eur 5 million for registration and identity card equipment . 
when i was in kosovo the other day i was very struck by those who told me that the initial stages of the election campaign had been conducted with considerable professionalism and style . 
they referred to some of the election meetings , for example , that they had gone to . 
maybe they do not yet have decorous televised debates with jim lehrer , with everybody avoiding being rude about one another , but they certainly have started their election campaign with a good deal of brio . 
i hope that will continue , that the election process will produce results in which everybody in kosovo from every group will be able to feel that they are sharing in the administration of their local communities . 
i would like to dwell a little on the answer given by mr patten on the elections in serbia . 
the people of serbi. including , i suspect , mr milosevi. know perfectly well who won the elections on the first round , which accounts for the fact that mr kostunica not unreasonably has argued that the election process should now be recognised and he should enter into the responsibilities for which the people of serbia have clearly elected him . 
the sooner that happens and the sooner serbia can rejoin the european family the better , as far as i am concerned . 
whether , when that happens the honourable member will be looking back nostalgically to the days of mr milosevic , we will see . 
arms trade code of conduct ( continuation ) 
mr president , i congratulate mr titley on his report , as others have done earlier today . 
as many of us said at the time in 1998, we saw the code of conduct as a very important first step towards having common and responsible arms export policies . 
but we saw it as a beginning and not by any means the end of the process . 
it is important to recognise that , at a time when our european concerns can seem somewhat abstract and rhetorical , controlling weapons is a real way in which member states ' governments , the commission and parliament can demonstrate the positive benefits of being able to work together here for a common approach to arms control . 
now we have to look at how we can further strengthen that code of conduct and in particular make it legally binding . 
we see dealers buying cold war weapons in eastern europe , flying them into african war zones and creating terrible suffering . 
it is important to develop ways in which eu candidate countries can be brought into the information exchange and into consultation mechanisms . 
candidate countries should also be involved in discussions on the further development and strengthening of the code . 
what we would like to see is a consolidated european report which should be published and scrutinised by this parliament . 
all proposed transactions organised by arms brokers should be subject to the licence approval of national governments and all countries should require all arms broking activities to be licensed . 
finally , arms fuel conflicts all over the world . 
we urge our governments in europe to tighten up the controls on the movements of these lethal weapons . 
the globalisation of world trade makes arms cheaper , more readily available and more difficult to trace . 
the technology and expertise that is available should be used for something constructive in society , something that will benefit people rather than something that is going to annihilate and destroy people . 
we should be focusing on the conversion to non - weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapons manufacturing countries around the world . 
whatever the case , arms exports exist and it is therefore useful and it is a step forward to have a code of conduct on arms exports , which sometimes run counter to the principles that should be the identifying features of the european union : conflict prevention and the defence of human rights . 
i would like to add that , in addition to the countries of the european union , all the countries of central and south - eastern europe that have close ties with the eu , cyprus , canada and others have contributed to this positive development . 
mr president , i am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because , as everyone up there can see , there are very few people down here at this time of night . 
the court of auditors took the same view in 1997, when it wrote that there was a latent conflict between the power to grant approva. and thus expenditur. and the responsibility for subsequently evaluating the same expenditure in accordance with the criteria for sound financial management . 
the commission 's fast - track proposal seeks to implement the recommendation of the committee of independent experts by creating an internal auditor who operates separately and independently from the financial controller . 
i have no doubt that its implementation will be one of the keys to the success of the reform package announced by vice - president kinnock in april . 
i am proud of the fact that the committee on budgetary control has been able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time . 
many thanks , therefore , to the other members of the committee for their help and in particular to mr dell ' alba , whose work as rapporteur for the committee on budgets proved invaluable . 
let us hope that the council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency . 
while our committee welcomes the broad gist of the commission 's proposal , my report presents a number of changes which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of powers work . 
our committee 's amendments seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remains responsible for ex ante financial control , and the internal auditor , who is responsible for ex post control , and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control systems . 
secondly , the commission 's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions . 
while this makes sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget , such as the european parliament and the council , it does not necessarily make sense for the other small institutions which have a financial control staff of no more than four . 
while these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor , it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller . 
it must be clear , however , that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period . 
when the recasting of the financial regulation is completed , hopefully within one to two years , it must apply fully to all institutions . 
some members of the committee have argued that the appointment of an internal auditor should be made compulsory for all institutions at this stage . 
of course such a notion has superficial appeal , but if it leads to the appointment of at least 20 additional officials without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gains it should be resisted . 
it is important , however , that institutions which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously . 
i was surprised to discover that in at least one of the smaller institutions no audits were carried out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the financial regulation . 
the third change to the commission 's proposals contained in my report is therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement . 
one of the problems parliament has faced in recent years is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions . 
i therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities . 
finally , institutions must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel . 
one of the key changes advocated by the commission is the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control . 
this proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this parliament as , the commissioner well knows . 
result : the new director may come from the outside , but he immediately finds himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established . 
i hope we will not see a repeat performance here ! 
i can understand the commission wanting to show that it can produce quick results ; but when you talk to commission officials , you get the sense of a mood of growing depression over the past months , and not only among the so - called losers , for of course some people are bound to lose out in any reform . 
we cannot make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulations , and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulations , a number of aspects will need to be laid down definitively . 
if we lay something down for large institutions , the neutrality principle proposed by the committee of independent experts should then apply across the board . 
i am not in favour of making any exceptions to this rule . 
public opinion is so sensitive in this area that i feel this parliament should deal with this topic every year , and not only at the discharge stage . it should also deal with the question of how matters can be improved in terms of control , and , in the light of public opinion , we cannot do enough about this . 
mr president , our group also supports the rapporteur and thanks him for his good work . 
i believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform . 
we believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management . 
but we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control . 
we too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control . 
in future , the administration must be able to react more quickly . 
however , we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control . 
that is another thing this house decided in january and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge . 
unlike the internal audit , the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made . 
these ex ante controls are essential because , unlike their national colleagues , the commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision - making . 
independent counter - checks are essential in order to avoid errors . 
if in future these audits are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas , we will also manage to prevent the controls from being too unwieldy . 
it is essential for the financial controllers to remain independent , which means they must not come under the same directors - general they are checking . 
in short , the controllers must not be under the orders of those whom they are checking ! 
parliament has repeatedly made that clear too . 
unfortunately , we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the commission in this respect . 
i would ask the commission to take the necessary steps together with parliament ! 
i would also like to point out that article 22, paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the member states must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical , mental or moral development of minors , in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence . 
therefore , we are all aware that , in practice , this is certainly not a simple undertaking . 
however , in the light of these considerations , our task is to define the objectives which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine , reliable protection for minors . 
firstly , we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors : i refer , in particular , to filtering systems and programme classification systems . 
it is our job to do something , and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minors with our first " television without frontiers " directive . 
i am thinking now of mr hoppenstedt , who fought for the v chip . 
but what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier ? 
not much ; children usually know how to handle it better than adults , which means we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation . 
we do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level , but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country . 
of course i also think that we are not in a position , either as politicians or as technicians , to tackle this problem on our own . 
and that is one of the findings that has come out of the highly commendable " study on parental control of television broadcasting " that is the subject of the commission communication . 
despite an impressive number of international studies , there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption . 
someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media , but that does not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the media image . 
that is a most important finding , for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well - being of children and young people and , in particular , we must not mistake the real causes of the sad reality of youth violence . 
youth violence is the result of a build - up of several factors , such as experiencing violence in the family , suffering serious social disadvantages , having poor chances for the future because of lack of education , which leads to frustration , which in turn finds its outlet in violence . 
that fits in with the experience i myself have gleaned during ten years of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts . 
systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis . 
i entirely agree with the president of the commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution , and i am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the eu must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross - border nature . 
the eu should stick to the key political issues . 
we should also ban mobile phones , the wap phones we hear so much about , which all the youngsters will soon be carrying about town , putting their lives at risk from traffic because they are watching television programmes and absorbed in material from all the different states of the european union displayed on their mobile phones . 
i do not , therefore , agree with the words of the liberal member who has just spoken . 
i am afraid that the heavens and the satellites will soon be raining signals from all over the union down on all our states . 
and it is therefore important for a european directive to be adopted to prevent the transmission of harmful material . 
mr president , commissioner , our children access and use televised , printed and new media on a daily basis and as a matter of course . 
information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis . 
at the same time , a huge selection of different entertainment programmes is available to them , usually without any controls . 
aside from all the positive aspects , we must not disregard the negative side - effects of this ease of access . 
children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of media brutality and violence , which is simply too much for them , especially because no limits are imposed on these offerings . 
so all those concerned , starting with the children , via the parents , the teachers , the countries , the european union and , beyond them , the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects . 
the public must be made more aware of the effects of this constantly growing wave of violence and support measures must be taken . 
parents are in particular need of help here , and in the following form : parameters to protect minors in the media context throughout the european union , the introduction of filter systems available at low cost , legislation to protect minors and assumption of responsibility by the media , enterprises and private and public - sector providers . 
these measures must not be restricted to television but must apply to all accessible media . 
the candidate countries must of course also be integrated in this process even at this stage . 
we are responsible for ensuring that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression are not presented as hip or cool or as examples to be copied but as deeply reprehensible . 
we have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directives and providing the necessary support . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one sunday evening a fortnight ago in the south of france , johan , aged 17, and robert , aged 16, murdered their childhood friend , romain , with a firearm and a baseball bat , for no reason or motive , just like on tv . 
they also said that they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone in real life . 
this occurred not far away and not very long ago . 
with regard to the protection of minors in the media context , the definition of common criteria is therefore , of necessity , minimal , given the cultural , moral and social variations in our member states . 
establishing minimum criteria is the very least the european union can do for its children . 
i would also support the rapporteur when she explains the need to make sure that all families are guaranteed the right to an affordable filtering system . 
that being said , these devices must not , and cannot , exonerate broadcasters and educators from fulfilling their responsibilities . 
children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering systems better than ourselves . 
during the nineties the commission produced several recommendations on the issue but no practical solutions were found . 
i therefore hope that , this time , a solution will be found once and for all , so that mobility throughout the european unio. of students , young persons undergoing training , young volunteers , teachers and trainer. will become one of the crowning glories of the european union , putting paid to that paradox whereby it is easier for goods , capital or services to move within the european union than it is for the citizens themselves . 
this is why the category of researchers should be included , mr evans . 
i therefore call upon the member states to make every endeavour , alongside the commission , to resolve the bureaucratic and other problems of mobility , and to set specific goals in the form of a two - yearly action plan and a final report . 
this is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every european citizen . 
mr president , in my capacity as draftsperson of the committee on petitions , i should like to congratulate mr evans on his excellent report on the mobility of students , researchers and persons undergoing training and to thank him for having taken the concerns of our committee into account . 
of all the petitions we receive , many relate either to mobility within the european union , and in particular that of students , researchers and persons undergoing training , or to the recognition of qualifications . 
after all , the experiences which these people gather contribute to a broader understanding of european cultures , they enhance professional experience and the command of languages , encourage familiarity with the european patrimony and increase the chances of finding employment . 
this is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students , volunteers , university teachers and researcher. yes , i include researchers in this as well . 
in line with the 1996 green paper on mobility , this group should also benefit from the recommendations in this report . 
i believe that the european commission was wrong to exclude them . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , promoting the mobility of students , trainers and teachers is being seen as an ever more important part of the european strategy . 
it was given attention , for example , in lisbon last march at the summit there , in which matters of employment , social participation and the information society were focused on . 
in the lisbon conclusions , mobility was recognised as an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training . 
the greatest credit goes to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problems involved . 
mobility is not to be promoted by noble objectives but by removing the day - to - day obstacles . 
i hope that the main amendments adopted by the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport will be received positively by the council , as they deserve to be , and that legislation is speedily brought into effect . 
when it comes to student and teacher mobility , experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration , but with the social , tax and immigration authorities . 
we also agree that there is a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear , comprehensive information regarding their social security rights . in addition , we agree that direct and indirect taxes such as the tax payable for renewal of residence permits should be abolished immediately . 
commissioner , we call upon you to act incisively within the commission on this unresolved matter , so that , in full respect for national powers and sovereignty , we will indeed be able to talk of a europe of peoples , a europe of citizens , but also a europe of culture . 
for if europe is not a europe of culture , it will never be europe ! 
mr president , i would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work which he has done on this report and also to congratulate the members of the committee on employment and social affairs and the committee on petitions who have drafted opinions . 
this is a very sensitive subject because , as my colleagues have already pointed out to the commission and council , a lot of hindrances are put in the way of students , lecturers , people undergoing training and volunteers with regard to mobility within the community . 
freedom of movement for persons , goods , services and capital is enshrined in our treaties and yet young people , who are the future of the european union and perhaps have fewer prejudices than some of us adults are denied opportunities because of the bureaucratic barriers put in their way . 
despite several opinions from the courts , recommendations from commissioners and actions at council level , nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the italian education minister . 
action needs to be taken to ensure that those inequalities do not continue . 
as the commission and parliament , we can demand compliance from programmes that are funded by the commission . 
we cannot allow universities not to recognise qualifications . 
universities that do not comply , however , must forfeit their subsidies . 
there must be clear checks and monitoring , even if only of a sample , and above all , a web site , where students can register their complaints . 
this is not expensive at all . 
we are not only protecting the rights of young people , since the same applies to researchers . 
it is pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researchers . 
mrs reding , mr busquin and his directorate - general are not doing anything about the training of researchers , nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors ' training . 
this has today created a void in the european union and unless the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport addresses the problem , europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the media , in the cinema or in research in information technology . 
our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge . 
we cannot allow this field to be taken away from us , even if this makes things uncomfortable in terms of the european parliament working closely with the commission . 
i think we should ask mr prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people studying abroad do not feel like orphans and that researchers are not left without support , at the mercy of what their rectors decide . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is our declared aim to make europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world , an economic area that is able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion . 
so we must make every effort to close the existing gap between words on paper and the actual , practical difficulties the european citizen still encounters every day . 
here , the european dimension in the field of education and training plays an important role . 
thank you very much , commissioner reding . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
( the sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m ) . 
mr president , mrs péry , commissioner , the reports that the commission has drawn up on equal opportunities in 1997, 1998 and 1999 are very important documents and the reference to the treaty of amsterdam is a significant step forward . 
articles 2 and 3 of the treaty of amsterdam , covering equal opportunities for men and women and article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the european union . 
we are aware that women do not participate sufficiently in the decision - making process in politics , business or unions . 
mr president , minister , commissioner , i should like to start by thanking our fellow mep , mrs dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to parliament after her recent weeks ' campaigning . 
we know that lone dybkjær did what she could . 
i am a man in an eu within which men and women do not have equal opportunities . 
it is worth repeating that . 
sometimes , some peopl. even colleagues in this assembl. seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities , but they do not . 
just as some people have said , it is enough to look at this assembly : the majority are men , the majority of those making decisions are men , and when the european council meets it consists solely of men . 
there is one female head of state in europe . 
i therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society , for example in the labour market . 
the choice of training and profession for men and women will depend on their own personalities , talents and interests . 
to respect and value these differences shows that we still have our feet firmly on the ground . 
the campaigns launched by the dutch government to encourage girls to select more exact science subjects and so - called male professions , have failed miserably . 
a european repeat of these debacles appears completely pointless to me . 
i just have to get something off my chest . i find it shocking that the representative of the council should mention the fact that equality should be enforced , yes enforced , would you believe , in the home . 
i do hope that she shares my view that the government has no right to intervene in the private sphere . 
human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to god , their creator , on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other . 
that was over 40 years ago . 
after all , we are already discussing the fifth action programme on the equal treatment of men and women . 
but we all know only too well where the real problems lie , and that the lack of political wil. particularly in the member state. the lack of willingness on the part of the social partners , the hesitancy of the political parties when it comes to involving more women in the decision - making processes , and also - let us be honest about thi. the mentality of many men and women , are responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs . 
once again , we have been left in no doubt on that score . 
we have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposals from the commission , than we do for studies and fine declarations and speeches . 
firstly , improvements are called for in the existing directives , for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security , with respect to public and company schemes . 
i would remind you , in this connection , of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce , as a result of which , payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive . 
i would put you in mind of the overdue improvements made to the ' caffeine - free ' free directive of 1986 concerning equal rights for self - employed people , including spouses that help ou. those millions of invisible workers , most of whom are wome. and whom are engaged in small and medium - sized agricultural enterprises without any form of social security . 
five years ago , we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject , one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business . 
there were two sessions of round - table talks organised by the commission , and we have not heard another word since . 
that was three years ago . 
we did the same thing , incidentally , in new york , at the beijing + 5 conference . 
i was the rapporteur in peking and the co - rapporteur in new york . 
the polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of polish women . 
i met with some very positive responses there . 
then the evaluation reports can use clear criteria and give us an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress . 
after all , one of the main criticisms that i receive from grassroots women 's organisations is that when applying for financial support from the european union , they have to make very detailed predictions about their future work and its outcome . 
yet in reports like this , we do not have anything like the same detailed information . 
greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace . 
we should be encouraging better dialogue with women everywher. after all the european union is seen as a pioneer in terms of equality legislation . 
the reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward , but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics , we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men . 
with regard to participation in the decision - making process , either at political level , in the business world or in the trade union movement , women are still in the minority . 
whilst this situation can be explained to some extent by the difficulties women face in the labour market and within the family , it is also true that political parties must shoulder their democratic responsibility to guarantee equal opportunities for women to participate in political life and in the decision - making process itself , in order to put an end to the scandalous situation that still exists at the beginning of the new millennium . 
my final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the european union . 
because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policies which we have applied , we have an obligation to help them and i therefore feel that the commission and the council should call on the member states to adopt the mechanisms which allow equality to be applied to all their policies . 
we have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged europe which we are preparing . 
mr president , welcome back to parliament , mrs péry . 
thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality . 
many of them have lost their jobs and , with this , comes violence against women , sex discrimination and the trade in women . 
today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage - earning women all over europe , including france , where 15 % of them live on less than frf 3 650 a month . 
worse , so - called equality is sometimes turned against women : for instance , in france today the incorporation of a directive is going to make night work legal for women . 
a strange notion of equality . 
in conclusion , fine words and nothing concrete . 
that will not be enough . 
that is what we will be saying in brussels on 14 october with the world march of women fighting against violence and for real work for all . 
those are the essential conditions for real equality . 
mr president , i will not reply individually , except to mrs torres marques , because her question is really direct and personal . 
i was indeed sorry to see that maria de belém roseira was no longer the representative . 
she was very active during the portuguese presidency , but it is not up to me to make that decision , it is up to the minister for employment , whom we have invited to the conference on gender equality . 
my third comment is about your doubts : plenty of speeches , plenty of documents , plenty of reports , but not enough actual progress towards quantified targets . 
it is true that the reality in the european union is that we have to take decisions as fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issues . 
nevertheless , i believe in the need to fight for quantified targets , and to implement policy through indicators . 
i did not mention this in my speech , but i am fully intending to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the ministerial conference , because we need an instrument for monitoring those indicators , and for exchanges of good practice . 
fourth point : the issues of the future . 
two of you mentioned new social rights , new fiscal rights . 
i can tell you that will be the central theme of the swedish presidency , and i shall be following it with great interest , because the progress made will certainly inspire french action . 
fifth point : the charter . 
the average participation of women is 18.6 % in europe , 28.9 % in regional parliaments and 30 % in parliament and there appears to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6 % from one year to the next . 
the second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which , at european level , is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23 % to 24 % and , in some regions of europe , is as high as 40 % . 
the third interesting statistic concerns domestic violence , the violence which women suffer at european level . 
i fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report . 
i have taken your comments on board and i see that we need to concentrate on analysing data , especially the results of successful strategies and successful initiatives at national and european level , in order to give the report a strategic slant . 
however , i need your help here . 
my services face huge problems collecting data from national governments . 
there are several countries , although one could cite examples for all countries , where it is impossible for us to collect statistics , where it is impossible for us to collect their experiences and results at national level from innovative policies in time . 
i believe that , if you work together with your national governments , you can help the commission to collate this data quickly , so that it in turn can present an analysis of them in the sort of report which you require . 
with amendment no 15, parliament wished to introduce a recital urging the customs authorities to apply customs rules correctly , to establish monitoring measures in order to ensure that it was applied consistently and to facilitate action against fraud . 
the council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the community customs code and pointed out that there is a green pape. which is currently being converted into rule. specifically for combating fraud . 
we were therefore also able to accept this amendment not being incorporated . 
finally , amendment no 11 requested that this modification to the community customs code enter into force before 1 january 2000 and is , therefore , no longer valid . 
mr president , in the increasingly open economic climate in which the european union must operate , and given the need to establish trade relations that ensure the competitiveness of undertakings , it is crucial that we establish a legal framework that sets the same rules of play for everyone . 
the progress made on the internal market , the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the markets and the progress of the information society mean that the community customs code needs to be brought up to date with the development of community and international trade . 
hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that was proposed at the time with the aim of simplifying and rationalising customs procedures , precisely in response to the demands of the new realities that i have mentioned . 
on the other hand , it was also necessary , as i understood it , to establish effective monitoring measures to ensure the uniform application of customs procedures across the whole of the community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loopholes that could facilitate fraud . 
as the rapporteur pointed out , however , neither the council nor the commission adopted the specific amendments that i have mentioned , because , among other reasons , they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the community customs code . 
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as the rapporteur pointed out , accepted that approach , and therefore decided not to re - introduce the amendments . 
i personally continue to believe , however , that the text that was adopted by parliament at the time responded much better to the new realities that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets , insofar as the elements of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendments that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rules would be complied with and that the same procedures would be followed when applying them . 
a customs code is not the place for establishing rules on fraud . 
that is something that depends on the correct functioning of administration and , clearly , in a legislative debate we should not be discussing the subject of fraud . 
taking advantage of the fact that the commissioner responsible for the internal market , mr bolkestein , is here , i would like to point out that a few years ago the european parliament established its first committee of inquiry , which was to investigate fraud in the transport of goods . 
there was a report by mr bouwman , an excellent report that we adopted , in which considerable fraud was revealed , for example , in the case of tobacco . 
there were goods , particularly tobacco , which were entering through a non - community country in the european economic area zone , going through the community zone and then mysteriously leaving the community zone on paper , but without actually leaving . 
currently , for example , there has been a drop in the price of bananas in the european union . 
we could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomatoes , in which we see prices being continually undervalued because goods are being introduced through certain community ports without authorisation . 
therefore , while recognising , as the council and the commission have said , that this amendment was not appropriate in this case , i would like to , once again , take the opportunity to point out that the procedures for monitoring imports in the european union are not working , that fraud is being committed and that this fraud is not only bad for community taxpayers , but also for the functioning of the internal market , and even for loyalty to third countries . 
if we want third countries to accept commitments , the european community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with , because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the community by means of smuggling , why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions ? 
i therefore welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement on this subject . 
i think that the modifications are very positive , but i would like to take this opportunity to ask the commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in community customs . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although it is true that the text is flawed , as the chairman of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and the rapporteur have already underlined , i would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution is an example of transparent , simplified and efficient community legislation . 
after all , in the community customs code , a successful attempt has been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , which surely must always be the objective . 
i can only applaud the customs code , and i am , therefore , somewhat more positive than mrs ferrer , for example , for it indeed forms the basis of various areas of community policy within the framework of community action of the national customs authorities . 
the goal to achieve simplified yet quality communication whilst building in a sufficient level of flexibility with regard to the basic rules , thus improving the procedure for collecting duties and offering a higher degree of adjustment of the provisions with regard to offering goods at customs , meets one of the requirements of the single market , and that has been achieved in this case , so much so , in fact , that many countries have drawn on this model in order to speed up the process to be able to take part in international trade . 
in broader terms , the community customs code is one of the most important legal instruments for establishing the amount of outstanding duties and to establish to whom these are due . 
the code forms the legal basis for levying these duties and , as such , one of the key instruments for protecting the financial interests of the community and for ensuring the smooth running of the community policy in different areas . 
in short , i believe i can safely say that the administration now has all the possible levers at its disposal in order to fulfil its task efficiently and within the timeframe provided , and i assume that the european parliament can invite the administration to make the results of this legislative resolution felt as soon as possible . 
mr president , i would like to ask the commission to adopt a position on the request made in the legislative resolution for the appropriate measures to be taken in order for there to be a modification of the community customs code , as mentioned by mr beysen and as i have also expressed . 
i welcome the major overtures which have been made with regard to this dossier , which has been the subject of long and intense discussions within the council . 
finally , in direct response to the question raised by both mr beysen and mrs palacio , i can confirm , on behalf of the commission , that we will be only too pleased to meet and carry out that request . 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place today at 12 noon . 
explanations of vote - recommendation for second reading palacio vallelersundi ( a5 - 0254 / 2000 ) 
-- ( de ) experience shows that the economic operators want to have the option of paying import duties in the place where their headquarters in the union is located . 
we independents therefore suppor. above all , in the interests of enabling the internal market to function successfull. the demand of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , for the commission to draft a legislative proposal concerning the place in which the customs debt was incurred . 
report evans ( a5 - 0255 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted in favour of the evans report . 
i would like to start by congratulating the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs , mr mantovani , on the substantial amendments he tabled to the commission communication , a communication which , among other things , relates to the movement of young students and young researchers within the european community . 
i said ' young ' , and therefore the pensioners and elderly people , whose interests i am trying to protect , should not have to concern themselves with this directive . 
but time waits for no man : one day the young people will become old people as well ; the young researchers will also grow old and , it is to be hoped , pensioners . 
the snp welcomes this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace . 
the unfair treatment of workers on the grounds of race , religious belief , disability , age or sexual orientation can in no way be justified in a modern and socially just europe . 
this directive gives member states a great opportunity to enhance the rights of workers across the european union . 
the snp is pleased to support this legislation , which is in line with our party 's policies of ending discrimination in all its guises and of positively backing measures to ensure equality of treatment for all citizens . 
moreover the snp sees this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlying objectives of the european union in recognising that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assists the eu 's aims of permitting the free movement of its citizens . 
amendment no 18 : the directive under discussion concerns a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and the over - generalised wording in amendment no 18 is not relevant in all aspects to this directive . 
it is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in member states , which , in any case , are fully justified for reasons of psychological development , and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market . 
for these reasons i voted against the amendment , although discrimination in employment and occupation in all its forms must be opposed . 
with regard to disability , the principle of equal treatment entails the identification and removal of barriers in the way of persons with disabilities who , with reasonable accommodation , are able to perform the essential functions of a job . 
while the proposal continues to allow differences of treatment on the grounds of age they have to be objectively justified . 
the proposal also allows positive action to redress gender imbalance . 
these proposals deserve the serious attention of the member states and the other community institutions . 
the eplp has voted for the mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it is firmly committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and is broadly supportive of the overall objectives behind this proposal . 
however the eplp has strong reservations about the following areas . 
on disability , whilst we welcome the principle of the proposals , the uk are justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation , but we do not want to impose our model on other member states . 
however , we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the disability discrimination act , although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required . 
on age , the eplp welcomes the principle of fighting age discrimination in employment and training . 
we also feel that the directive should be clear about which differences of treatment on the grounds of age are permissible and which are not . 
we have concerns about several elements which appear to be overburdensome : notably application of the legislation to volunteer workers in charities and to public posts , and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistics . 
we are concerned about the inclusion of health , social security and assistance as there are considerable national differences in how these matters are handled and whether they form part of the employee / employer relationship . 
there are also elements which , we feel , should be left to member states such as overall implementation , provision of training to particular age groups of workers , the nature of a mediation system , and how smes are to interpret the directive . 
finally , some elements should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different member state practices . 
we believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the uk and other eu countries . 
i voted against these reports because they enshrine within them the principle that sex perversion is elevated onto the level of holy marriage and sex only within the marriage bond . 
they also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god , the only infallible rule of faith and practice , forcing such believers to employ those who propagate and practise acts of sex totally against the scriptural ethics . 
it is on this issue alone that i voted no . 
broadly speaking , the christian democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality . 
we have therefore decided to vote against this amendment , but we support the report as such . 
report van hulten ( a5 - 0260 / 2000 ) 
i have abstained on the van hulten report because i do not think we should increase the number of controlling authorities within the european institutions . 
this ' control frenzy ' actually leads to officials being freed from responsibility , to a situation where everyone tries to palm off responsibility on the controllers , and the controllers of the controllers . 
the european union suffers from a bad image among many citizens . 
rapporteur van hulten expressed the following view in an interview with a dutch weekly magazine , " it is called europe , it is in brussels and is corrupt " . 
thanks to the action taken by a " whistle blower " and the committee of wise men , corruption has been brought out into the open . 
in the interview , mr van hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud , waste , but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision - making . 
rapporteur van hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the commission proposal : what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit . 
but if mr van hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective union , we , along with the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budgets , cannot see why he should exempt smaller institutions , such as the committee of the regions , from internal audit duty . 
this view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation . 
naturally the number of transactions in the smaller institutions is smaller than in the large one. the 800 000 transactions performed annually in the commission eclipse the 10 000 transactions performed annually in the committee of the regions . 
but this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department . 
although the rapporteur shares my view that all institutions must be given equal treatment , he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen months ' time . 
in my view , if the opportunity presents itself to step up efficiency within the eu institutions , each day that passes while we are waiting is one too many . 
to set up an internal audit office in the institutions will naturally require effort , but that effort will remain the same , whether it is made now or in the future . 
the image of europe is not served by the efficient operation of the large eu institutions alone ; in many respects , it is probably the small ones that make all the difference . 
report titley ( a5 - 0211 / 2000 ) 
i am sure , in common with all my colleagues , we support the proper management and control of arms exports in the european union . 
we have many examples of how uncontrolled and unscrupulous arms exports have exacerbated many of the conflicts in the past century and even into the present time . 
we , in europe , along with our colleagues across the globe , have to see that the mistakes and greed of the past are not repeated . 
the reasons of my vote on this report relate , in the main , to the question of closer european union relations with nato and also the onward rush to a common defence policy . 
many will speak about peace and conflict resolution while at the same time will be making deals to sell arms to combatants . 
if this two - faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome . 
as stated at the outset , i am in favour of greater control over arms exports , but this issue should not be confused with other political initiatives . 
even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the european production and export of arms politically , we are sceptical about the titley report , mainly for the following reasons . 
there is no link between the development of the arms industry and eu cooperation in the area of military policy . 
the eu has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so - called petersberg objectives ( crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the eu ) , but it has no common defence policy . 
the individual eu countries are members of nato and the weu , or else are non - aligned . 
the world would be a safer place without weapons . 
i am therefore in favour of a code of conduct which renders it impossible to produce and export arms and which results in arms factories switching over to the production of useful commodities . 
in general terms , i endorse the small steps forward , even if they do not , by any means , completely lead to the solutions put forward by myself . 
this hypocritical resolution seeks the implementation of a ' european code of conduct ' while simultaneously declaring that the defence industry is ' economically and strategically important for the eu ' . 
we take the view that the restructuring of the defence industry should not be motivated by the political ambition to create a common defence policy , but by the strategic and industrial requirements of the major companies and member states involved . 
on this basis , link - ups between european and north american companies are as much to be welcomed as between european companies . 
while we can support a code of conduct which sets out a level playing field with a set of rules to which we can all voluntarily adhere , we do not wish to encumber industry with more unnecessary regulations . 
in particular , we do not support the proposal , in paragraph 9 of the resolution , that the code of conduct should be made legally binding . 
while there is much that we can agree with in this resolution there are a number of fundamental flaws and this is why we have abstained in our vote . 
i welcome the main provisions of this report , which highlights once again the importance that the european parliament attaches to the protection of our young children in europe . 
if all these proposals are to be translated from theory into practice , we need to create filtering and classification mechanisms which allow parents to select the programmes which are suitable for their children . 
report dybkjær ( a5 - 0198 / 2000 ) 
this third annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the european union sets out the highlights and successes of the year 1998 . 
it must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law , the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist . 
women are the most vulnerable to unemployment . 
the 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under - employment of women . 
it also analyses the measures taken to incorporate employment policies strictly focused on women or policies to restrict gender discrimination in employment , for example , in employment contracts , types of employment and remuneration . 
moreover , women are often in ' flexible ' jobs ; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority . 
i therefore fully support the rapporteur in urging the commission to pursue its efforts and in particular to strengthen the ' strategic ' nature of its annual reports , by assessing the effectiveness of policy initiatives rather than contenting itself with describing them . 
in the face of plans and practices to exploit and oppress , in the face of discriminatory tactics , we call on women to enforce and claim their demands together with men within the framework of a wide grass - roots battle front in each individual country . 
although it has some positive points , this motion merely skirts round the problem . 
we fear that its proclamations and good intentions are , yet again , no more than ' lame excuses ' . 
that concludes the vote . 
topical and urgent debate 
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
peru 
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions : 
b5 - 0777 / 2000, by mr medina ortega and others , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the crisis in peru ; 
b5 - 0780 / 2000, by mr di pietro , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on the situation in peru ; 
b5 - 0790 / 2000, by mr lipietz and mr nogueira román , on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance , on the crisis in peru ; 
b5 - 0792 / 2000, by mr marset campos and mr di lello finuoli , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , on the crisis in peru . 
mr president , i have here a speech i gave on 9 april 1992, in which i referred to the coup , the so - called self - inflicted coup , by president fujimori , and at the time i said that it was not acceptable for a democratically elected president to relinquish his legitimacy by relying on the armed forces . 
since the last electoral farce , fujimori has lost his legitimacy and not only that , but he has lost the political support that he previously had . 
mr president , i would prefer it if , for once , we could have a debate on latin america following well - prepared discussions in the committees , rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other . 
it seems to me that we only ever deal with events in latin america on a case by case basis , but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy . 
it is a shame , because the continent merits more attention . 
i am not so sure whether this will be the case though , because there have already been one or two disturbing developments on this front , and i will only be convinced once fujimori has actually stepped down or been voted out of office . 
i therefore think it is extremely important for the european union to get fully involved with this country , and with the situation in peru , for example by maintaining an orderly dialogue with the forces of opposition . 
i would like us to send the delegation that we wanted to send to the election. which then failed to take place for reasons we are all familiar wit. to peru now , with a view to supporting those who are working towards democratic reform in the country . 
mr president , commissioner , i believe that the events in peru are evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of words and their tangible weight . 
the term in question is the word ' democracy ' . 
peru has a parliament which has been elected by universal suffrage and a president who has used the powers of persuasion of the army to violate all constitutional precepts . 
i feel that this resolution marks a key point in parliament 's political initiative . 
i would like to focus briefly on one of the subjects covered by the report : the call for parliament to send a delegation . 
the european union has got to do something and do it quickly . 
the process of democracy needs to be consolidated , but consolidated with political instruments and human resources . 
we must ensure that , when peru reaches its goal , it has candidates who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the peruvian people 's demand for political renewal and genuine democracy . 
if these weaknesses are not dealt with , there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too . 
the commission therefore supports the organisation of american states in the continuation of its work as per the schedule agreed at the time , and this notwithstanding the difficult conditions and numerous imponderables that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new elections . 
the commission , in tandem with the member states , is currently examining how we can best help , in practical terms , in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections , and , if need be , as observers of the process . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the joint debate is closed . 
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m . 
afghanistan 
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions : 
b5 - 0776 / 2000, by mr van den berg and mr sakellariou , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the situation in afghanistan ; 
b5 - 0778 / 2000, by mr dupuis and others , on behalf of the technical group of independent members , on the situation in afghanistan ; 
b5 - 0781 / 2000, by mrs dybkjær and mrs malmström , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on the situation in afghanistan ; 
b5 - 0789 / 2000, by mrs schroedter and others , on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance , on the situation in afghanistan ; 
that is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups , which i have the honour of defending here . 
essentially it calls on the council presidency to bring its influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country . 
it calls on the commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone . 
finally it insists , and this is the essential point , that the european union coordinate its initiatives with those of neighbouring countries to impose a solution whereby peace , stability , and respect for international law and the most elementary human rights can be re - established . 
we are well aware that this will not be an easy task , but here i would like to quote the motto of a great european , william of orange : " hope is not necessary to engagement , nor success to perseverance " . 
mr president , afghanistan has the worst human rights record in the world , both in terms of the number and the severity of the violations committed . 
the predicament of afghan women is a particularly apt case in point . 
in other words , the conflict is far more complex , there is no solution in the offing and yet , as we all agree , there is an urgent need for one . 
the eu has an important task before it in this respect . 
there can be no recognition by any member state , as long as afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights , notably its systematic discrimination against women . 
the commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measures for the people , doing everything possible to enable the ngos to provide aid to afghan women and involve them in their activities . 
around a million people , most of them children , have been mutilated by anti - personnel mines . 
the urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives . 
there is one point which i must stress in particular . 
there has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now . 
funding has been allocated for 2000 and will be provided for 2001 as well . 
we need to take immediate action to prevent thousands of children inadvertently triggering tragic explosions while they are playing in the fields , and receiving disabling wounds . 
we can do this . the operations have been endorsed and are viable , but the funding is being held up by bureaucracy , by the need to assess previous actions and by confusion over the responsibilities of the different departments . 
ladies and gentlemen of the commission , look up from your texts , find out what is going on outside the realm of documents : thousands of children are in danger . 
rise above sluggishness and uncertainty . 
should i find that there are bureaucratic stumbling blocks here , as you put it , then you have my word that i will do all i can to overcome these obstacles with all speed . 
the honourable members are well aware that the commission has a long - term commitment to the afghan refugees and those who have been displaced within afghanistan itself . 
between 1991 and 2000, the commission made a total of eur 400 million available for refugee aid , humanitarian emergency aid and food aid . 
a significant slice of this was earmarked for mine clearance and associated information campaigns conducted by un agencies , european or afghan non - governmental organisations . 
the union has resolved to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country , and it is as plain as day that this will not come about until human rights and fundamental values are given full recognition . 
mr president , i am speaking to confirm the agreement of the various political groups that have tabled a motion for a resolution on the kidnapping of a spanish jesuit in colombia and to inform the house that we have decided to withdraw it in view of the fact that the person has been freed . 
two other community citizens have also been freed today . 
therefore , i am not going to discuss the draft resolution , as it no longer exists . 
nevertheless , colombia is clearly a country that deserves our attention . 
but as mr linkohr was saying , the problem with latin america is that we only concern ourselves with these countries when there are problems . 
i think this is a good time to highlight the need for the european union to draw up a comprehensive policy on latin america which could perhaps prevent these countries from regularly going through the crisis situations that some of them have experienced . 
mr president , i would like to reaffirm what my colleague , manuel medina , has just said . 
fortunately , in this particular case , we can welcome the fact that the spanish jesuit and other spaniards , as well as other community citizens , have been released . 
it is also true , however , that colombia , which we frequently discuss here , has several problems . 
at the moment , for example , there is a colombian priest , oliveiro medina , who is in brazil . 
his extradition to colombia could put his life in danger because we have already seen , in the last resolution on colombia that we discussed , that more than 24 human rights defenders have recently been murdered there . 
unfortunately , we all hoped that we would not have to discuss colombia again . 
unfortunately , we may have to discuss it again , but i think that the european union should have a fundamental rol. as manolo medina was sayin. in latin america in general . 
and reducing budgets for latin america is not going to help us to play the role that we should be playing there . 
mr president , i would like to share in the happiness of my compatriots and fellow members who have talked of their satisfaction at the freeing of the spanish jesuit alejandro matos and of other community citizens . 
the commission is deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in colombia , particularly in respect of the massacres perpetrated recently by paramilitary forces in the so - called peaceful communities of san josé de apartado . 
we urge the colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes . 
the commission deplores the ongoing human - rights violations in colombia and entreats the warring parties to continue the peace talks and work towards a lasting peace in colombia , based on a negotiated solution . 
in particular , the commission would like to have some say in the process when the european union puts together an aid package in support of the colombian peace process . 
the commission has already offered to coordinate the measures for a package of this kind , and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few days . 
furthermore , the commission has proposed organising in brussels a follow - up meeting to the donors conference that took place on 7 july in madrid . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the joint debate is closed . 
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m . 
the dispute about the name is a dispute between greece and the country of macedonia . 
not us , but the government under prime minister georgievski , and also the albanian leader , xhaferi , and above all , the representative of the council of europe , max van der stoel . 
people from different ethnic backgrounds must be able to live together in macedonia . 
this could provide a good role model for the neighbouring countries and help to stabilise the entire region . 
mr president , it makes a nice change in this parliament to be able to reflect on positive developments in south - eastern europe , and very often the subject is macedonia where , despite all the problems this country has to deal with , the two largest groups of the population co - exist in peace , even form a coalition government and have now adopted a new act on higher education . 
that is a breakthrough on an issue which has caused a great deal of problems for a long time . 
at long last , the albanians now have the opportunity to attend university courses in their own language and within the official education system of macedonia . 
that is a real step forward for macedonia . 
as far as i am concerned , it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred , as is often the case these days , but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful , multi - ethnic society . 
that is a development which , in my view , deserves unqualified support from the european union . 
finally , i would like to spend a moment on something which , normally speaking , i do not think belongs in a european parliament , namely the role of a fellow countryman . 
i am proud of the fact , that this time round , the role of mr max van der stoel , the high representative for minorities of the osce , has proved crucial in this issue . 
in my view , it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders . 
it appears to me that cooperation between slavonic macedonians and especially albanian - speaking macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in tetovo . 
this initiative has been on the cards for years and still there is no talk of official recognition . 
it appears to me that the recognition of degrees from tetovo university is a major step forward . 
i , myself , was educated at a university which was a ' free university ' , free from church and state influence , yet government - funded . 
the outside world should do all it can to help the albanian speakers integrate in their country . 
perhaps i could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the commission and the high commissioner , mr van der stoel , has already got off to a good start . 
our combined efforts have enabled us to solve a similar problem that existed in two other european countries , i.e. estonia and latvia , and i am grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the osce high commissioner in this respect has been extremely constructive and valuable . 
i believe the same will apply to macedonia . 
the commission is intending to make eur 1 million available for the current year , under the national programme for macedonia , in order to support the implementation of this law . 
the funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward toda. possibly this very hou. to the phare administration committee . 
if the member states adopt this financing proposal , a financing agreement will be concluded with the government and a detailed project will be drawn up in close cooperation with mr van der stoel in the coming weeks . 
the phare funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year , i.e. in 2001 and 2002 . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the joint debate is closed . 
greek cabotage operators are running their new ships on the routes to italy , where there is competition , and their old ships on the greek routes , where there is no competition , and that is how safety standards drop . 
it seems to me that the factor which needs to be quantified here as the result of this tragic incident , is what needs to be done at european union level , because the bigger picture is the safety of shipping in the european union . 
i should like to say , as far as the resolution is concerned , because there are a number of amendments , that my amendment on shipping registers is covered in the text , it is already there . 
this is so , if only because , in the words of the early english poet , john donne , any man 's death diminishes me because i am part of mankind . 
the fact that the ill - fated ship was 34 years old and was not included on the list of ships whic. and this too is wron. were exempted from the additional inspections required under directive 98 / 18 / åc , is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always finds a way , for which governments and regulatory authorities are to blame , of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations , at the expense of passenger and shipping safety . 
the legal framework for shipping in greece and in the european union in general has proven to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new , stricter rules , especially for very old ships , rules without derogations . 
equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which , by operating as a private , profit - making company , is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling . 
even the tragic shipwreck has not thrown up any useful conclusions . 
on the contrary , innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners ' wider objectives . 
hurrying to suspend cabotage in greek seas , as earnestly called for , including in this joint resolution , will intensify profit - seeking competition between the shipping companies , with even more tragic consequences for passengers . 
mr president , my group would also like to express its condolences to those involved in the samina express disaster . 
such a disaster is always a sad event , especially if it could have been prevented . 
let us therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give us a clear picture of the situation , at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measures . 
judging from the survivors and those involved , we can already draw two conclusions . 
disasters at sea are often caused by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who are both able and aware of their responsibilities . 
as a result , domestic and foreign voyages by passenger ferries to or from union ports are covered by a complete legal framework . 
the commission therefore contacted the greek authorities as soon as the express samina went down , requesting clarification of the application of community law . 
as a result of the check requested by the commission , 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards . 
the member of the commission responsible , vice - president de palacio , therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001 . 
the commission also intends to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulations , in order to ascertain if they need to be changed . 
finally , i should like to stress that the commission is convinced of the need to make european legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the community . 
only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accidents . 
madam president , my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week , because i happened to be in jerusalem and the gaza strip when the disturbances took place . 
the explosion had been brewing for months : it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements ; when you cannot find work to support your children , which is the case of my friend talal who works as a builder in the settlements , maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family ; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around . 
ariel sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd . 
while condemning all forms of violence , we cannot make any parallel between the israeli violence and the palestinian violence . 
on the one hand , there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and , on the other , there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation . 
this is not the work of hamas : it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision - makers . 
it is the revolt of the palestinians who live in israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in israel . 
we must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re - establishing negotiations : the fighting must cease , the israeli soldiers must be withdrawn , there must be an international inquiry , at which europe must be present , and the palestinian people must be protected . 
it would be enough for the european union and the un to make it clear that the un resolutions , starting with resolutions 338, 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes , apply . 
this would in itself have a major impact and could change israel ' . by no. firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity . 
the events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is . 
so we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible . 
the only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talks and mr solana , who has just left us , is right to concentrate his efforts in that direction . 
the fact is , they either accept perpetual talks , generally under the auspices of the united states , and endorse the expansionist policy of the state of israel or , with the aid of other muslim countries and their traditional friends , they create a new and more favourable balance of power . 
this new balance of power calls , in particular , for the immediate proclamation of a palestinian state , the use of oil as a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence . 
madam president , the peace process in the middle east is extremely fragile . 
such a situation requires tact . 
provocations such as those initiated by mr ariel sharon , must be refrained from . 
however , violence is not a legitimate response to provocation , and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not . 
if the european union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process , it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action . 
to this end , my group has tabled two amendments to the resolution to that effect . 
it is not acceptable only to condemn israel if the palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is slightly bizarre that we should be discussing serbia in this chamber at a time when the serbian parliament building is going up in flames and hundreds of thousands of people are on the streets . 
despite this , i would like to make an attempt at explaining why i am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment . 
there is of course the support of hundreds of thousands of peopl. the figure of one million has even been moote. who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help mr kostunica against the wishes of mr milosevic . 
there are also the latest reports on the role of the police , which , as has been apparent for some time , have been in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime , and which , as it appears from the first reports now coming in , have opted to side with the demonstrators ; according to the latest reports , the same could happen with the army . 
there is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation has resigned , this being a signal , i believe , that he refuses to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the milosevic regime any longer . 
i would like to make two minor observations with regard to the future . 
all the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors , have laid down their combat weapons and have allied themselves with the demonstrators . 
this was reported on radio index . 
mr president , if you will allow me , i would like to explain why i have abstained in the vote on the resolution regarding the middle east . 
i believe that in delicate matters such as these , preference should be given to a diplomatic stance and , as far as the specific content of paragraph 4 is concerned , it does not comply with the standards for a balanced resolution , in my view . 
especially with regard to the committee of inquiry , i would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated . 
last week , on 24 september , an extremely important referendum was held , in which the danes rejected the single currency . 
from the operational point of view , i believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that has been provided for in the current financial perspective , and the functioning of the guarantee fund require an improvement in the mechanisms for achieving the objectives of quality and efficiency in union loans that are given budgetary guarantees . 
it does not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the eib . 
the interinstitutional agreement provides for a series of three - part dialogues to take place within the budgetary procedure . 
given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve , which is set at eur 200 million per year , there is no reason why we should not discuss the priority uses of this margin in coming years . 
we cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees . 
in the budgetary procedure for 2001, our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance . 
it is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the eib . 
legislation is already in place to achieve these aims . 
the chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into , and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year . 
a delegation of the european union has been primed for action , and as you know , the summit at the end of november will take place precisely in zagreb , in order to give croatia the message that the country is welcome in european union circles . 
this is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt . 
in its recent past , croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption . 
it is therefore only justified that the mandate of the european investment bank will be increased by 250 million . 
the european union is acting as guarantor . 
but this is exactly where the problem lies , because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of serbia , namely the fact that the council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the balkans last year in berlin . 
it is not acceptable that the rift between the pledges and promises made by the european union on the one hand , and the reserved funding on the other hand , should be as huge as it is now threatening to become . 
having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today , the european union cannot afford to arrive in belgrade empty - handed tomorrow . 
i would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the balkans . 
i support the amendment by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , which is right in saying that this loan is important , but that , in the final analysis , the overall programme , given the necessary financial backing , is more important . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments . 
i am sure we are all agreed that croatia must be given political assistance , but political assistance also entails financial support , because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . this can only be achieved , of course , if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere . 
there is now every reason for treating croatia in the same way as slovakia and other central european countries which can join the european union if they so wish . 
the damage done by the war has not yet been cleared , as we witnessed recently . 
mr president , i wanted to be here not just to state that i voted for this aid for croatia but , above all , to have the chance to express my satisfaction , as others have today , at the democratic events taking place in serbia at the moment . 
after many years of difficulties for this peopl. all kinds of difficultie. we are at last , extremely democratically , beginning to welcome serbia back into the community of the peoples of the european union . 
i hope that negotiations will soon get underway and , as with croatia , that aid will also be granted to the serbian people , who deserve our greatest respect . 
thank you , mr fatuzzo . 
madam president , the minutes of the parliamentary sitting tell us that the issue was raised in this chamber of the racist attack made on a teacher in verona . 
the minutes also say that parliament condemned the incident and , in particular , expressed its solidarity with the teacher . 
madam president , i understand that you will shortly be announcing the decision of the french government to terminate my mandate as a member of the european parliament . 
we would , however , like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons . 
the fact is , this apparently technical report , which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature , is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture . 
we think , given that for the moment we are at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on gmos , that it would be wiser to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceedings and to deal with this problem once the framework has been clearly defined , which should , in principle , be in the month of january . 
we therefore propose postponing examination of this report . 
is there a speaker to support this request ? 
madam president , as we have already told the rapporteur and the house repeatedly , there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro - organisms , namely the report by david bowe , which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure . 
i repeat , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that mr le pen was given for appealing against the french council of state had expired or until a decision by the latter . 
and i am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 may that you yourself , madam president , read in plenary . 
as you said , the council of state rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection . 
there is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary , which is an obligatory act according to primary law , specifically paragraph 2 of article 12 of the act of 20 september 1976 . 
mr president , commissioner , minister , ladies and gentlemen , may i first and foremost thank my fellow meps and the commissioner together with her offices for the excellent cooperation we have had in the framework of this report , and may i also seize this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contributions of the many ngos , the social partners and the experts who have helped us formulate an ambitious social agenda on behalf of parliament ? 
it has often been said that ' social policy is a productive factor ' and this is true , for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better . 
that is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in european policy . 
we must be able to see where progress is being made ; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at european level . 
hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard , similar to the one already in use in the internal market , which details specific measures , expiry dates and deadlines . 
hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussions at the annual spring summit . 
secondly , i would like to comment on the instruments . 
it is true that the open method of coordination , which has been used within the sphere of employment since luxembourg , has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority . 
we would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the social affairs council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty . 
furthermore , we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security . 
thirdly , there is a ' but ' . 
stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation , because we should lay down social rights in europe too . we should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a european internal market . 
what matters is that something is put on the agenda and that something is done . 
paragraph 14 lists a number of points we think are important . 
i cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for us the importance of those paragraphs relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring . 
in its communication , the commission has found a framework for the social agenda which i think admirably reflects the spirit of the lisbon summit . 
mr president , first of all , i should like , on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance , to thank anne van lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in terms of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it . 
the apparently technical term ' social agenda ' in fact covers the day - to - day realities experienced by our fellow citizens . 
we must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious european ' social model ' . 
we have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed , which are the groups most motivated to establish a european union which is a community of citizens . 
the issues to be discussed select themselves : we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the lisbon summit . 
we must give the people of europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within europe , in order to ensure that their fundamental rights , including social rights , are safeguarded . 
this has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad . 
i would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications services . 
it is a veritable catalogue of measures which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term . 
in conclusion , the objective of giving new impetus to european social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one . 
it demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive . 
the method used , on the other hand , seems more debatable . 
regarding the financing of ngos and their participation in community policies , there is still no legal basis in the treaty , paragraph 13 . 
similarly , with the new social agenda , there is a desire to pass legislation at community level , at the risk of harmonising to minimum standards and short - circuiting social relations within the member states . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations , one being anna lancker , for her outstanding report , and the other being anna diamantopoulou , for her outstanding submission . 
it is an ambitious agenda , and i still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection . 
the council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time . 
what is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy , based on the lisbon decisions , indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature . 
we do not want over - regulatio. and i say this to the british delegate who spoke befor. but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection , and not the rules of the nineteenth century . 
we also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from developing the social economy and the services sector . 
what is not so new , and the subject of repeated demands , is lifelong learnin. which is something even the smallest member states have done something abou. as are the long overdue reforms to the european factory committee law , the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers , and freedom of movement . 
i would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work , employee participation and labour relations . 
i would like to particularly stress the benefit which , in terms of employment , can be obtained by women through giving them improved access to employment with guarantees in terms of working time and salary . 
i think that there is also a great advantage , if we succeed in getting the directive applied , modified and updated , with regard to maternity leave : for women to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when women have to continue working during that period . 
i also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life . 
it is going to enable women to continue in their jobs without neglecting their family obligations . 
neither can we forget what the e - europe initiative means for new jobs , new technologies and the information society , where i think women have an important role to play . 
we support a pact for employment and social cohesion , a european action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives , social regulations for new forms of working such as tele - working and new forms of self - employment , the minimum wage , and guaranteed income . 
the european union has already stood idly by for far too long , watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the member states . 
we object to the fact that the commission and the council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda . 
social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis . 
the working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : the policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated , and also supported by legislative measures , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods . 
as for my third point , there are some rights that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social europe : the right to a minimum income , the information and consultation of employees , the european collective agreement . 
these are points which , we know , are contested by the conservatives in europe , but to which we , in our group , attach great importance . 
minister , commissioner , we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues . 
i hope , minister , that in nice the french presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda , since embarking on the construction of a social europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens . 
mr president , i should like to extend my special thanks both to the rapporteur , mrs van lancker , and the french presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed to date . 
the second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy . 
here i would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion , the new work which we have started on pensions and social protection , policies for people with special needs and , more importantly , i would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect , i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy . 
we must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy . 
i think that this analysis will give us new , interesting results and approaches . 
the third strand in the content is enlargement . 
to be brief , social policy , the new social standards and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate countries with the member states are one of the most important features of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that . 
this brings me to the third area which has engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation : the means . 
i think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation , i.e. do we or do we not need legislation , is old hat . 
clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in europe , but changes on the job market , changes in the economy , changes in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements . 
when we need to deal with these new requirements with legislation , we shall not , of course , have any hesitation in doing so . 
if we can deal with them in other ways and with other methods , we shall do so . 
the proposal for a scoreboard , for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda , is a huge challenge . 
the problem is that , because of the legal basis which it has in the treaty , the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws , a set of directives with specific steps for the member states . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women . 
in this respect , the napoleonic code , which was framed in france at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of europe , must shoulder a large share of the blame . 
all the same , the texts before us are not entirely lacking in quality . 
i am delighted , moreover , that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life . 
this report does , however , give some cause for concern . 
amendment no 18, for example , which seeks to support action by candidate countries to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choices alien to their culture . 
in this area , as in many others , it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates . 
it is not right for a handful of women , expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies , to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women . 
i should like to see this house confirming this bold change of course . 
a decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliances which too closely bind a number of pressure groups to the european commission and to some political groups in this house . 
i could go even further , and say it would be ennobled by such a decision . 
this is something my group will take into consideration in its final vote . 
( applause from the uen group ) 
mr president , we are aware of the progress that has been made in recent years with regard to the situation of women , particularly the legislative progress , but there are still situations of real inequality in everyday life . 
the low level of representation of women in political and economic spheres and gender - related violence are two clear signs that structural discrimination against women is continuing . 
this programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns , needs and aspirations of women are taken into account in all policies . 
equal access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men , which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave , maternity protection , working time , employment contracts , etc . 
equality between women and men in civil life , allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
we especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in women and domestic violence . 
time is pressing . 
women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision - making processes . 
our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area , together with the parliamentary committees of our member states and of the candidate countries , in november in berlin . 
with regard to state aid , moreover , problems apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid state aid is paid back to the national exchequers . 
i also think the time is ripe for re - assessing whether the procedures and sets of rules we have at present are as good as they could be . 
the world is not , of course , always so easy for those who have to follow the rules and procedures we are involved in devising . 
i think it is necessary for clear rules to be devised for what is called the relevant market . 
with the passage of time though , i have begun to wonder whether the commission is not , in fact , gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned , or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition . 
i will reiterate what i have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind : competition is not an end in itself . 
commissioner monti , on behalf of the italian radicals , i too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced , which commend both your work and the work of the directorate - general for competition . 
in my opinion , a particularly regrettable factor , if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop , is still the presence of large numbers of powerful public companies in sectors which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process . 
i could mention , for example ... let me see ... the state monopoly of retirement pensions , but i will restrict myself , more pertinently , to firms operating in the sectors of general interest services . 
it is my view that , in these sectors , competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the state is both regulator and operator . 
i know , commissioner , because i have had occasion to read and hear your views on the matter , that your response to the objections is that the articles of the treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms . 
competition is therefore always a means to an end. it is a vital cornerstone of our model , in terms of political order , of the socio - economic market economy . 
i stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything , which is why competition is not completely unrestricted , nor should it be . 
we therefore need two things : firstly , in the interests of increased transparency , we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidies that influence competition , and secondly there must be areas of our day - to - day lives and behaviour which are not subject lock , stock and barrel to the dictates of european competition policy . 
the sports sphere or the numerous non - governmental organisations in the social and health spheres , to quote two examples . 
who , like us , says ' yes ' to a functioning internal market , must also have the courage of their convictions to say ' yes ' to european competition policy . 
therefore , we welcome the modernisation of competition policy , which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals . 
in view of the enlargement process and globalisation , it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relations within and outside the european union . 
i therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the community on the one hand , and the fact that european competition policy now extends beyond union borders . 
on a final note , we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because , increasingly , the market is not the national market . 
we need to promote the citizens ' awareness of competition policy , so that they recognise the advantages . 
we also need to step up debate in the european public arena on the relevant proposals , because they are frequently misunderstood . 
what i mea. and this is directed at the public , not the commissio. is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation , but must instead lead to europeanisation . 
when you delegate responsibility , you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility ! 
lastly , boosting the citizens ' autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , european competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions . 
they are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment , and i hope that in future this can be made clear , so that these aids , these internal aids , which affect regional development and the regional economy , in which transport aid is a key example , might continue . 
mr president , i would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the commissioner . 
i would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of parliament , and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter . 
i merely want to clarify that i spoke here on behalf of the second largest group , and expressed a real concern of ours , and if you heard mr caudron speak , then you would be aware that this is not something i alone am concerned about , because it is also something that bothers another mep . 
and so i only spoke on behalf of my group , and not for parliament as a whole . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m . 
therefore , although the increase in convergence of states reduces the likelihood that the mechanism will be used , it must still have sufficient resources to meet the simultaneous needs of several countries , should this be necessary . 
this is why we propose to reduce the amount available from eur 16 billion to eur 12 billion . 
this resolution also envisages the possibility of considering creating a special mechanism providing financial assistance to the balance of payments of the candidate countries . 
clearly , this is a possibility for the future and therefore does not have a bearing on the present situation , but it is a possibility which i considered that we could at least examine in some depth so that we will be prepared should these issues arise . 
mr president , i would like to thank mrs sartori for her report , which we have found very valuable . 
in view of the current level of economic , financial and monetary integration , the likelihood that these member states will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view , but the mechanism must , nevertheless , remain in force . 
secondly , the possibility of having recourse to funds contributed by other member states to finance the loans granted under the mechanism should be eliminated since , for various reasons , it has never been used . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the reason we wished to defer this report was that we wanted to ensure consistency in the work of the european parliament as it influenced the course of european policy . 
on 5 july , some of these issued the beaune declaration , expressing their great concern at the introduction of gmos into their sector . 
the draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the european union material that complies with the minimum requirements of the directive should be approved unreservedly . 
finally , we must ensure that the new provisions on genetically modified varieties are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts , or texts in preparation , in this field . 
should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified , it would be preferable to delete the provisions relating to this point from the draft directive . 
we have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine - growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this . 
the regulations proposed by the directive , moreover , favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees , which is a basic requirement , in order to effectively support the restructuring of the community vineyard sector , which is a key point in the new com in wine - growing . 
mr president , the need for a new directive revising the conditions for the marketing on community territory of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine has become urgent . 
personally , i find the ' 68 vintage rather a fine one , but apparently the commission has decided to modernise . 
the very first lines of the klass report clearly stress the value , not just the economic value but also the cultural value , of grape and wine production . 
i am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept amendments nos 35 to 40, tabled by mr graefe zu baringdorf , which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90 / 220 . 
however , we cannot accept amendments nos 28 to 34 tabled by mrs isler - béguin and others , for they would involve revoking the entire part of the directive which contains references to the gmo varieties and the related risk assessment . 
moreover , these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
we cannot accept amendment no 41, tabled by mrs schierhuber , either , for it concerns an excessively detailed definition in the light of the amendments proposed by the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
if we were to accept this amendment , we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade , which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention and , once again , thank you to the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
mr president , if you permit , i should like to ask the commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , amendment no 1 . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m . 
( the sitting was closed at 9.17 p.m ) . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
the minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed . 
are there any comments ? 
madam president , i see from item 13 of the minutes , entitled ' communication of the announcement of the removal of mr le pen from office ' , that you presumed to speak on behalf of parliament , and that the chairman of the committee on legal affairs presumed to speak on behalf of that committee . 
i would simply like to point out that parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion . 
while the council of state was in the process of examining the appeal lodged by mr jean - marie le pen , the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequences of this appeal , nor even from assessing the decision taken . 
as a result , i consider that article 7 ( 4 ) of our rules of procedure has not been respected . 
mr gollnisch , i can assure you that procedures have been respected absolutely , in both the spirit and the letter of article 12 ( 2 ) of the act of 20 september 1976 . 
as you know , the committee on legal affairs advised me to wait for the decision from the council of state , which i did . 
however , everything was done exactly by the book , and in conformity with the rules of procedure . 
madam president , the minutes state that i spoke on the situation in spain . 
i spoke on the repression in spain and the situation in the basque country , which is totally different . 
i would not speak about eta terrorist acts and say i am speaking about the situation in spain . 
i would remind you that the greek word for such independence would be ' auto nomoi ' , which means ' having its own laws ' , and as the rapporteur says " its own rules " . 
biarritz also saw the unanimous adoption of the charter of fundamental rights and , yes , there was indeed great ambition and a novel method . 
for the first time in a document of this type , civil , political and social rights were placed on an equal footing , with a commitment to establishing a community of human values . 
i would also express the wish of my group and of a good many ngos to see the charter evolve and continue to improve , in order to guarantee , amongst other things , more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the european union , for employees , for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised . 
these changes can of course only work to the disadvantage of the smaller states , as might be suspected judging from the manoeuvring of some larger states , who are banking on scenarios for the reweighting of votes and the composition of the commission and speculating on the future composition of the commission in order to earn themselves a little extra room for manoeuvre with regard to reweighting . 
the real issue is that of giving the commission , by means of elections , a genuine legitimacy that relates directly to the citizens . 
we must therefore urge everyone to return to the roots of our union , to have the courage that giscard d ' estaing and helmut schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the european parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979, and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a president of the commission who is also the president of the european union . 
madam president , the biarritz summit was a breakthrough for reinforced cooperation . 
i am aware of the criticisms that you have addressed to the german chancellor . 
i am no more qualified than you to meddle in german internal affairs , but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if i am not mistaken also moves into line with what the commission wants . 
a strong and effective commission means a commission that has even greater legitimacy by virtue of representing the general interest of the community , and not by dint of a perceived intrusion of the intergovernmental phenomenon into the way it operates . 
when we proposed a rotation on an equal footing , it was precisely to show that the idea was not to pit the smaller and larger countries against one other but that , in a commission with a ceiling on commissioners , those countries which we incorrectly refer to as ' large ' and those that we equally incorrectly call ' small ' would be represented on a perfectly equal footing . 
this is the clear position of the french delegation , and this is clearly the preferable solution . 
what i noted in brussels yesterday , was that an idea is beginning to gain credence , that of having one commissioner per member state , which will probably be adopted at nice , perhaps placing a ceiling on the number of commissioners at a later date . 
i therefore believe that we will clear up this ambiguity and that we must do so while effectively ensuring that the commission continues to be a strong body . 
i would like to briefly return to matters of external trade policy , as this is a very serious matter . 
mr barón crespo asked several questions which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision . 
i will end with the questions asked by virtually all the speakers concerning the binding nature of the charter , and am anxious to make myself clearly understood on his matter . 
this text will stand out because it is clear and because it is accessible . 
it is the first european union document that the citizens can consult without feeling completely alienated from its content . 
that really is something valuable , as was emphasised by all the members of the european council . 
there remains , of course , the question of its legal power . 
i will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process , one in which we are well versed , of having the charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions . 
it has to be said that within the european council there are a number of delegations , and i might even say a large number of delegations , that are opposed to the charter being binding in nature , and therefore to it being incorporated into the treaties as early as nice . 
given the circumstances , how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development ? 
we will strive for this change , as our presidential role dictates , but i would not want to lead parliament to believe that developments that cannot come about will come about . 
i do not think it will happen . 
in any event , madam president , i believe that biarritz has contributed something very positive , and that is the unanimous approval of the charter . 
a second very positive thing was the adoption of the charter in its entirety . 
i believe that now , in this policy of forward movement , the inclusion in article 6 ( 2 ) of the treaty on european union is very important , as there is no sens. and i do not wish to be inconsisten. in the european union deciding not to provide a legal basis in the treaty for the union to be able to adhere to the european convention on human rights and , at the same time , talking in the same paragraph about the interpretation of fundamental rights based on this same european convention for the protection of human rights . 
it therefore seems that mentioning the charter in the treaty of nice is something that makes perfect sense . 
i therefore believe that with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow , we are giving a very clear mandate to our two representatives , mr brok and mr tsatsos , to enable them to present a proposal to this end at the nice summit . 
madam president , president - in - office of the council , commissioner , i have three comments to make . 
firstly , one sometimes had the impression that at biarritz there was an obsession with the debate between the smaller and the larger states . 
in a certain sense all this is quite natural . 
we are at last in the process of reopening the issue of major institutional balances and the way they would work within an enlarged europe . 
the institutions on which the european union is currently based were set up for three large countries and three small countries . 
no one in this parliament would understand it if no agreement on this issue was reached at nice . 
it is difficult but certainly not impossible to reach agreement in nice . 
it is clear from the debates that have been taking place across europe , including those in biarritz , that larger member states are seeking , in part , to bully smaller member states to reform the european union in line with the direction taken by larger member states and in accordance with their wishes . 
this is an unacceptable situation . 
let us reflect for a moment on the ratification procedure for any newly revised european union treaty . 
it is constitutionally imperative for a referendum to be held in denmark , portugal and ireland before any treaty can come into force . 
if the european treaty accepted at nice completely dilutes the influence and representation of smaller member states , it is going to be very difficult to sell it and secure approval for it in referendums in these three countries . 
decision - makers within the governments of the larger member states should remember that seeking the approval of the citizens in a referendum is not a mere technicality or a rubber - stamp operation . 
above and beyond this bitter admission , this europe so often promised , which seeks to be close to and receptive to the peoples of europe , would actually seem to me to be moving further away from this goal . 
is wanting to get involved with everything and everyone , beginning with what is happening outside our borde. when even the united nations , whose task this actually is , cannot successfully do thi. not a negation of this europe which is supposed to be closer to the citizens ? 
we would like to see similar zeal for action in the field when there are disasters in europe , such as the storms of december 1999 or the sinking of the erika . 
one might wonder whether such an approach is relevant in terms of coming up with real solutions . 
as is the case at every summit , the newspapers reported on the hope and anguish raised by this summit , the prelude to the treaty of nice . 
our debate today also has the same ring to it . 
the negotiators see the fact that there are malcontents on both sides as proof that they are on the way to striking the right balance . 
but in the end , as commissioner barnier has said , the aim is not to enhance the lives of our fellow citizens but to ensure the survival of the community structure . 
four revisions in fifteen years have not improved matters , and now we are expected to believe that a charter or a constitution might do something to change things . 
the leaders of europe have not formulated a clear vision . 
they have not clearly formulated their final philosophy . 
it is , rather , those who are demanding extensive reforms prior to enlargement who are guilty of that . 
what is needed is to act responsibly now and , in nice , to concentrate on resolving the issues left over from amsterdam : let every country have a commissioner . 
in sweden , supporters of the european union have always justified eu membership by saying that it would give us influence . 
now , the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have . 
i should also like to say that there is something remarkable about the fact that france , as the country holding the presidency , consistently uses its position to promote its own national interests . 
mr president , in our plenary sitting in september we experienced and shared moments of optimism and hope with abraham burg , speaker of the knesset , and ahmed qurie , president of the palestinian legislative council . 
a month and a half later , what we are now sharing is great concern over the way events are developing . 
on the one hand , there is the decision by the head of the israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition , mr sharon . 
mr president , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , i would like to say a few words on the subject of the middle east and yugoslavia , also in connection with contributions from previous speakers . 
following the summit meeting in sharm - el - sheikh where all parties involved were present in order to find a way to freeze the violence and to re - open the dialogue between barak and arafat , we established that it is very difficul. even if , for a fleeting moment , it seemed as if it were possibl. to halt the violence . 
we should also take a look at our own situation , however . 
it is important to take a step forward on the european energy taxation front , such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle . 
with that in mind , parliament is expecting the nice summit to take a step in the direction of qualified majority voting in those areas where taxation policy is disrupting the proper functioning of the internal market . 
biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the european union . 
the council presidency wants to abolish the cooperation procedure and replace it with the consultation procedure . 
this procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective . 
and finally , the charter . 
i gather that the document was well - received at biarritz and that it can be adopted following a number of legal clarifications and subject to an official declaration at the summit in nice , to be incorporated at a later stage in the treaties . 
examples include the european company , the pan - european liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services , which is stumbling along , the opening - up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation . 
a cautionary example of inappropriate behaviour is offered surprisingly by austria , which has just experienced unjust treatment itself , as that country is warning its neighbour , the czech republic , against using its nuclear power plant at temelin . 
the union does not now need visionaries with tunnel vision leading up to the year 2030, but problem - solvers that can see the problems that enlargement over the next 3 to 8 years will bring with it , and see the solutions to them . 
i am thinking in particular of my friend and fellow commissioner , antonio vitorino , who was very active throughout these discussions . 
i would point out that right from the start the commission indicated that it was in favour of the idea of giving legal effect to this charter . 
mr berthu talked about this charter as if it were a thunderbolt that had dropped out of the sky . 
all the same , we did make reference to the intelligent and open work that culminated in this charter , in which national parliaments representing national opinions participated . 
in any event , the commission has its place and is striving to secure genuine reform . 
i simply said , mr dupuis , that success or failure , genuine reform or inadequate reform , would be assessed on the basis of whether the community mode. which does indeed , mr moscovici comprise the three institutions you mentioned , but others to. would emerge from nice weakened , intact or strengthened . 
we are striving to strengthen it , and this is a way of allaying the concerns of many member states , and not just the smaller member states , on the place and the role that they will occupy within this community model . 
this was what struck me personally , and gives me some confidence that there will be genuine results at nice . 
finally , i would like to thank mrs randzio - plath for her intervention . 
i can reassure her and state that we , like the presidency , are determined to press ahead on the basis of the proposals made by mrs de palacio concerning european energy policy in the areas of reserves and conservation and support for renewable sources of energy , not least during the negotiations which we have just been talking about in the context of the igc on the extension of qualified majority voting in environmental matters . 
that concludes the debate . 
i have received seven motions for resolution pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the duhamel report has provided us , the european parliament , with the opportunity , barely two months before the european council in nice , to reiterate our position on the further development of the european union , and in so doing to take account of the need for the eu to become primed for action on the enlargement front over the next few years , as well as to demonstrate to our citizens the medium - term prospects of the european union . 
this framework must be enforceable both on the countries that want to participate in closer cooperation and on those that are not participating in it or at least not from the start . 
reinforced cooperation must therefore respect the principles set out in the treaties and be conducted within the single institutional framework of the union . 
on the other hand , it must not constitute a barrier to trade or precipitate splits in the common market , breaks in the links of solidarity and cohesion between the member states or , as commissioner barnier has said , an unravelling of the community acquis . 
the implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the european institutions . 
the treaties are difficult to understand , at times contradictory , difficult to read and uninspiring . 
beautiful and important european values are jumbled together with technical clauses in an unholy mess . 
this is really quite unacceptable . 
a clearer distribution of powers is required , as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle . 
we learned a very great deal from the work of the convention . 
it is a working method which , with certain changes , ought to be used to give people a still more important place in the process . 
it is about the future of the european union . 
as is well known , opinion on this differs widely in the various member states and amongst the various forces of society . 
in its content , nothing but jiggery - pokery ! 
as to the results it will achieve , a disappearing trick ! 
the hot air as regards the form is to be found , for example in paragraph 11 of the french version of the duhamel report , a constitution against , i quote , " a backward step " going backwards . 
but a backward step is always backwards ! 
paragraph 20 speaks of a constitution to discuss , and i quote , " their shared future together " . 
but if this future is shared , then obviously they are together . 
paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with , and i quote , the " issues not settled " . 
well , outstanding accounts may be described as ' not settled ' , and there may be answers outstanding , but not issues . 
that is why men and women prefer zidane and schumacher , because at least with zidane , they have the dream of breaking out of the social palestine in which you imprison them , whereas , with prodi , the prospect every morning , every evening and every day is gloomy . 
i have always rejected any form of differentiated integration for reasons pertaining to legal theory , but also for pragmatic reasons , believing that it would allow a majority of member states to determine the direction of policy , and deny countries joining at a later stage any codecision rights in these matters . 
i still clearly recall how , in the time before amsterdam , in what was still the institutional committee , discussions on flexibility went on for weeks . 
the arguments against and the warnings about a multi - speed europe , are still ringing in my ears . 
no one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now . 
mr president , i intend to talk about islands . 
the cost of transportation from an island to the mainland is three times the cost of transportation by road . 
farmers are often forced to cultivate a product and , if the product does not do well , it is destroyed . 
a kilo of oil , which is a staple product of the greek islands , costs less than a packet of cigarettes . 
and let us not forget that these people sometimes die on small islands when the weather prevents them from being moved to the mainland . 
we must therefore move in this direction . 
mr president , despite your final statement , which we would like to be of consequence but we fear will be otherwise , the criticisms made a while ago by this assembly regarding the current intergovernmental conference have proven to be justified . 
i hope that the french presidency will find a more efficient and imaginative way of assuring the candidate countries and the public throughout europe that we are not only addressing important technical issues but above all the political necessity to provide our continent with stability through the certain and guaranteed enlargement of our european union . 
enlargement , mr president , forces us to face up to the question of whether we intend to move towards purely economic union or to continue in our endeavour to achieve political union . 
in my view , the unity of europe cannot but be political . 
a simple single economic area , even with a single currency , is no replacement for political union . 
we cannot put this sort of limitation on our ambitions because that would presage the break - up of the union , even of economic union . 
obviously , it would be best if we had or if , in nice , we could set up institutions to take single common decisions by a suitable majority , possibly a double majority of populations and member states , which are binding on us all . 
no such institutions exist , or at least not to the required extent . 
mr president , two brief observations regarding the reports on our agenda today . 
with regard to the gil - robles report , i can simply say that it is an example of sound work carried out by our committee and that the vast majority of our group will support the report . 
the duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting . i would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our group . 
in our opinion , the new constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next european elections . 
mr president , i am sorry to rise again on a point of order but i do so to challenge the ruling you made earlier , not in the context of the debate but in the context of the rules of this house . 
if there is an equality of votes and if the honourable member did vote , even though her machine did not work , then the procedure in any parliamentary assembly is that amendment falls . 
. ( fr ) behind the convoluted wording of this text , there is an outline of a raft of measures , all harmful to workers . 
what is the meaning of the expression " the deadline within which member states are required to guarantee unemployed individuals a chance to access an active employment measure should not exceed two years " , if not a threat to unemployment benefits ? 
what is the meaning of " the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually , via part - time work " , if not a threat to the age of retirement , which is already far too high in many countries ? 
eu citizens are entitled to expect the highest level of safety with blood products . 
it is imperative that we safeguard the health , safety and confidence of patients , users and third parties and set conditions on placing such products on the market . 
we must at the same time seek to guarantee continuity of supply of safe products at affordable prices to both individual citizens and public health authorities . 
there is an italian proverb which says , literally : " laughter makes good blood " . 
pensioners and the elderl. who , like everybody else , would like to have a healthy circulatio. therefore approve of the fact that , every so often , i am able to introduce a lighter note into our proceedings , such as this preamble to my explanation of why i voted for the trakatellis report . 
my reason for voting for the report is , of course , that pensioners and elderly people are greatly concerned with their health , for it is they who are most frequently hospitalised , and they therefore welcome not only the movement of goods but also the healthy circulation of the blood . 
we ought to have studied the outrageous reversal of the concept of flagrante delicto which those authorities committed . 
before passing judgement , the french court of appeal and the council of state ought to have notified the court of justice in luxembourg that the question had been referred for a preliminary ruling . 
this is the legal course that our parliament should follow in order to be consistent with its principles and its legal code , as well as with the letter and the spirit of the treaties . 
a great many of us here would like to hear this stated by the court of luxembourg , which is the guardian of the law . 
klaß report ( a5 - 0195 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted against the klaß report . 
this is because it confirms the possibility of turning traditional vines into gmo vines and therefore the possibility that , in the future , we will be drinking genetically modified wine . 
i asked the pensioners who sent me here to the european parliament to represent the pensioners ' party whether they would like to drink genetically modified wine . 
in my country , greece , vines are extremely important ; they are an integral feature of the landscape and have been bound up with its culture and economy for centuries . 
and , greece is the only member state which produces and exports raisins . 
given that research into genetically - modified products has been developed and is controlled by a number of large multinational companies which are only interested in increasing their profits and have no interest in protecting human health or the environment , the precarious nature of the supposed authorisation and controls , which are riddled with holes , gives even greater cause for concern . 
it is proposed to allow material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which meets reduced specifications to be marketed when temporary difficulties arise without , however , specifying what these difficulties might be . 
or even , by way of derogation , for standard material for vegetative propagation to be supplied when demand cannot be met from other categories . 
in a number of member states , growing grapes constitutes an important economic sector , especially since they are used to produce alcohol . 
in april 1999, the commission proposed a wide - ranging reform of the community system of competition with regard to the application of article 81 ( prohibiting agreements between undertakings ) and article 82 ( prohibiting the abuse of dominant position ) . 
the rapporteur generally welcomes the proposals in the commission white paper on this subject but is apprehensive of the possible implications of the reform , which aims principally to decentralise the implementation of competition rules . 
she feels that abolishing the notification and authorisation systems and enhancing the role of national legal systems in disputes concerning community competition law will lead to the renationalisation of this policy . 
while we would not all agree with every aspect of eu competition policy , it has certainly been a successful policy over a period of 43 years and it has helped to prohibit the abuse of dominant positions by companies within the european union . 
i would not like to see a situation where the primacy of community law with regard to the implementation of eu competition rules and regulations was threatened in any shape or form . 
the uniform application of eu competition laws throughout the eu must be paramount . 
therefore , i welcome the call by the rapporteur to the european commission to provide additional guarantees concerning the application of competition law within the member states . 
this will include , in particular , involving the european parliament more closely in drawing up and implementing competition policy and monitoring the quality of legislation on competition within the various member states of the eu and the applicant countries to the eu . 
i put it to you once again , mr president : is this not also a state aid which should be included in the survey ? 
mr fatuzzo , i am unable to answer that question , for this is an explanation of vote . 
i am not the executive but rather the president of this house at this moment in time . 
during the debate yesterday evening , i welcomed the work of mr evans , but i was immediately bound to express my deep disagreement with the rather too liberal , not to say ultraliberal , tenor of his report . 
hence my recommendation last night not to endorse the report as it stands . 
whilst i could agree with the requests for increased transparency regarding state aid , and for the european parliament to be informed about the follow - up to aid approved by the commission , i called for state aid to be maintained in order to develop social cohesion , research and innovation or environmental protection , to offset gaps in the market , to promote european competitiveness in relation to other countries and to confront the fraudulent machinations of competitor countries , such as korea in the field of shipbuilding . 
i added that the supervision of state aid should be carried out within the strict framework of the treaties ' provisions and not according to the prevailing liberal ideology . 
i believe that , somewhere between the ' all - powerful state ' , which nobody wants anymore , and the ' non - existent state ' , which is simply the modern form of the survival of the fittest , this thing that many would call the ' european social model ' requires us to look for the balance between what can be regulated by the market and what state authorities should regulate ! 
as the right forced them to fight , i did not vote for the report . 
in fact , one can recall that 40 % grant aid is available for fixed investment costs for new businesses setting up within the objective 1 region in ireland . 
i welcome the recent statement that radical changes are now being implemented by ida ireland in terms of attracting more jobs to the objective 1 region in ireland . 
ida ireland has been reorganising that focus so as to win half of all new jobs from greenfield projects in the objective 1 region over the coming three years . 
there are too many regions presently at a disadvantage from an uncompetitive infrastructure and from the lack of the business support services which are needed if the required level of new and modern business investment is to be achieved . 
i drew the attention of the european commission to this issue in july 1999, and received a positive response . 
i therefore agree with the thrust of paragraph 4 which supports this viewpoint . 
i am less pleased with the idea expressed in paragraph 2 that state aid should not go up . 
that aid could well be indispensable to the protection of the environment and public services and to guaranteeing equal income levels for people living in economically disadvantaged regions . 
i back the criticism voiced with regard to tax exemptions , which fuels unfair competition in favour of aviation , as compared with other modes of transport , and i also support the incentives to save energy and look into renewable energy sources . 
my final verdict is therefore positive . 
unbridled competition has become the latest neo - liberal fad . 
everyone knows that , even if the rules of competition are transparent and apply to everyone , not that this ever was or ever will be the case , not everyone has access to those rules on equal terms , with the result that the familiar law of the jungle applies , might is right and monopolies rule ok . 
sometimes , when the consequences of this policy cause an outcry , state intervention , aid and other economic and fiscal incentives come along and go some way to restoring the situation . 
intervention does not even break the surface of the capitalist system and often supports selected companies and businesses . 
however , it is not these " deviations " that are being targeted in the desperate attempt to abolish state aid ; its purpose is to increase the profits of strong companies and consolidate their position on the market without any danger from new competitors . 
the less developed regions of the eu , the less developed sectors and the poorer social classes know that , without state intervention , the development differential will increase steadily at their expense . 
they know that , without a strong , productive and efficient public sector , there is no light at the end of the tunnel . 
they also know that the economy is being restructured and the public sector sold off not for their benefit but in order to support big business and increase its profitability . 
in other words , apart from increasing profitability , it also hands big business an important political weapon to combat grass - roots demands . 
we find the constant pressures and concomitant institutional measures , such as the proposed state aid register and scoreboard , unacceptable . 
there is a danger , once the eu is safely in control of large state aid , of its turning its attention to small - scale aid on the pretext of the competitiveness of small and medium - sized enterprises . 
big business is showing , in the choices it is making , that it is seriously worried about the possibility of competitiveness controls by the member states , not by the commission of the eu . 
the intolerable situation being forced on workers by the choices made by large companies and the eu is already causing widespread reaction . 
the number of demonstrations against " globalisation " and the rule of the uncontrolled laws of the market is increasing rapidly . 
attempts to erode measures to protect workers still further , the attack from all fronts on the rights which they have fought for , in conjunction with attempts to minimise the specific weight of the public sector and the balancing function which state aid can exercise , do nothing except increase grass - roots dissatisfaction and leave workers no choice but to fight and resist . 
that concludes the votes . 
in addition , we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure . 
parliament has been proposing cuts for a long time now . 
we have already this year exceeded the foreign policy budget by 400 million . 
the material was obviously useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge . 
so the committee would like to recommend to all the specialised committees concerned to take into account the results of those evaluations . 
in the end we tabled a very short paper to the committee on budgets with a number of recommendations which we hope will be taken on board . 
the house will no doubt be aware that i personally have taken an interest in the budget and tabled a number of amendments . 
i look forward in the future to seeing roughly the same sort of exercise and trying to get rid of a number of very small and more insignificant budget lines , as well as making this house and the commission much more efficient , do less and do it better . 
mr president , as draftsman for the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , i have no problem asking this house to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the committee on budgets on the initiative of either our committee or the general rapporteur , mrs haug . 
i observe , in particular , that following our requests , the committee on budgets has proposed a substantial increase in the credits made available to the european fund for refugees , funds which the council had rather imprudently , not to say rather stupidly , cut . 
finally , i am delighted to note that , in the field for which my own committee is responsible , no less than four new budget lines have been proposed for our approval . 
the first of these is for the implementation of a pilot project intended to fund an information campaign within the fifteen member states against the criminal scourge of paedophilia . 
i think this is a mistake which must be set right . 
at a time when racist and xenophobic acts are gaining ground , scandalously , in a number of european union countries , i think it crucial to boost the financial means needed to set up a technically reliable network for the collation of information throughout the union . 
i think that , were they to support this amendment , my fellow members would be setting in place a technically fair and politically timely act . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the vote in the committee on budgets was rather unsatisfactory from the point of view of the committee on economic and monetary affairs . 
secondly , i see people have been fighting tooth and nail over the mini budgets in the a30 lines . 
in fact , back at first reading , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens ' right to see their european laws upheld , and to avoid the eu falling into disrepute as a community of law , on account of delays . 
i am extremely grateful to the committee on budgets and the competent rapporteur for endorsing this line of argument and supporting our proposals . 
in particular , we will again recommend , at second reading , that 60 new posts be created at the european court of justice , and , in addition , that the necessary funding be made available in the budget . 
we also propose that eur 3 million be set aside , with immediate effect , in order to enlist the services of freelance translators . 
mr president , this is my first year in the european parliament and i have been struck during the course of this budget debate by the contrast between rhetoric and delivery . 
last year when we were discussing the budget , we had politicians in the member state governments who were posturing on the issue of renewable energy , whilst at the same time proposing major cuts to the save programme in this parliament . 
i found that to be a curious position . 
our citizens , not to mention this house , have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service . 
we in the committee on employment and social affairs favour a thrifty budget too , but not in this way . 
it fills me with confidence that together , we have managed to save our employment initiative for local engagement , which was launched last year , because this is the initiative that supports new employment policy measures at local level , whilst involving all players , ngos included . 
i also welcome the fact that , in future , we will aim to do more for health and safety protection in the workplace again . 
the new initiative for small and medium - sized enterprises will illustrate best practice in this sphere , and lend added value accordingly . 
i would like to pay tribute to the work done by the rapporteur , mrs haug , in trying to resolve some very difficult questions this year because of the immense pressures that have been brought to bear upon the budget at a very late stage . 
we must have the courage of our convictions and insist upon finding the very modest finance needed to fulfil our key objectives . 
the first is the decision by the committee on budgets to place into reserve the monies agreed for the life programme . 
this was an astonishing decision and left many of us feeling that this whole very important programme had simply become a football in a game between the budgets committee and the commission . 
it demonstrated that those bodies did not recognise the importance of this programme to the environment . 
we need to reverse that decision in the vote this week in the house and make those funds immediately available , because there is an enormous demand for their utilisation . 
the treatment by the budgets committee of several agencies has been proven to be unfair and unjust this year and in past years , in particular the refusal to increase monies to the drugs agency . 
if it is supported by the house this week , it will put a stop to the recently begun programme for the approval of orphan drugs for rare diseases . 
unless that funding is restored in a vote this week in parliament , i would anticipate a very serious situation arising and considerable distress to many people in europe . 
it is the duty of the house to give those points their support in the vote this week , to demonstrate its continued commitment to protecting the environment and improving public health . 
mr president , on behalf of my committee , i would like to make a few observations , starting with rural policy . 
i have to add , however , that sugar policy , for example , is now again the topic of debate , also within the commission . 
in fact , there is room for improvement here too , for example with regard to the tobacco policy . 
i know that it has not been easy and we therefore thank her even more , if possible , for her work . 
the common fisheries policy , ladies and gentlemen , represents a very small part of the community budget : we are talking about barely a billion euros . 
this is not enough to meet the challenges of the common fisheries policy , to finance the financial instrument for fisheries guidance , the fisheries agreements and our participation in international organisations , to monitor the implementation of the cfp , the common organisation of the market for fisheries products and aquiculture , research into the fishing environment and the compilation of data which is essential for the implementation of the cfp . 
the committee on fisheries , which shares with the commission the principle of budgetary stringency , has accepted the limits set by the latter in its preliminary draft and has indicated its concerns in certain budget headings . 
we have asked an indicative appropriation of eur 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the cfp . 
an information campaign disseminating the principle on which the cfp is base. the sustainable exploitation of marine resource. is essential . 
quality products must be highlighted , conservation standards , such as the observation of minimum fish sizes , must be circulated and we must explain to consumers the health benefits of eating fish . 
the cfp is tremendously important for maintaining employment in the peripheral regions , which are very dependent on fishing . 
our priorities are , and must be , to consolidate and increase international fishing agreements and to improve safety and working conditions within the sector and conserve resources . 
the cheapest jobs , ladies and gentlemen , are those that do not need to be created because they have not been lost . 
it is better to support activities that already generate jobs than to have to invest vast amounts later in creating new industries . 
in conclusion , i would particularly like to mention a topic with regard to which parliament is to issue its assent . 
i am referring to the fisheries agreement with morocco . 
the committee on fisheries asks that line b7 - 8000 should include an entry of eur 125 million to cover the financing of this agreement for the year 2001 . 
all parties must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations . 
year after year , parliament has protected the interests of the poorest countries in the european budget , and with moderate success , even though this has not been enough . 
even in 1999, as much as eur 3.2 million was refunded to the member states because those resources were not spent . 
for example , with regard to our aid to mediterranean countries , we have a backlog which has accumulated over many years of budgets . 
secondly , the incorporation of women into the information society , which is extremely important for the future ; financial assistance for women in central and eastern european countries , in the meda countries ; the fight against sex tourism in third countries , where there is a huge problem which affects women in particular ; and the promotion and defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of women . 
we must also bear in mind that all this is related to the fight against domestic violence , which is taking place under the daphne programme . 
we also hope that this heading will be approved . 
i urge the house to see that the ombudsman has adequate staff to do his job properly and the petitions committee has adequate tools to do its job properly . 
we must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective . 
let me turn to the overall strategy . 
this is the first budget debate for a considerable time without a substantive issue of dispute between parliament and commission . 
the framework agreement between our two institutions is now in operation even if it is disputed by a few of our members . 
no discharge is outstanding , the reform process started by the last commission under the strong urgings of our parliament has been taken up in earnest by this commission . 
some progress has been made but there is a long way to go . 
having always been in the vanguard for change in the european institutions , for example with our support for never giving discharge for the 1996 budget , we are now absolutely determined that the reform process will not be lost as larger and more political issues begin to dominate our agenda in the run - up to the nice summit . 
we focussed our efforts on three specific areas : better execution of the budget , more effective management of european policies and successful implementation of the reform package with particular reference to the new posts requested by the commission . 
before coming to that , a word on the position of the british conservatives . 
to the surprise of many in my delegation , we established a core strategy unanimously at the beginning of september and the 400 amendments introduced by some of my colleagues came as somewhat of a surprise to many of us in the budget committee . 
while some had a legitimate purpos. to improve financial control of this house over the budget , many more had a destructive inten. not to save money , but to delete very worthy organisations such as the european union youth orchestra . 
as it turns out , the moderate face of conservatism has for the most part prevailed over the more ideological and unacceptable one . 
there are some 30 amendments now retabled over and above those of our core strategy . 
i personally did not put my signature to them because one or two of them still go a little too far . 
yet a healthy majority of the conservative delegation wishes to play a constructive role in the european proces. unlike one or two members who can only think of deconstructing what is here . 
we want to be sure that funds set aside for specific purposes in the budget will be spent and not accumulated year after year . 
this is why we have called for a strategy from the commissioner to deal with the backlog of commitments , in particular in external policies , by the end of 2003 . 
it is my hope that the council will also be able to agree this strategy . 
thirdly , and linked to these items , is the request for more posts . 
we understand that there is a need for more personnel , but what is of most concern to us is that we do not grant this request until the reform process of the institutions is well under way . 
it is difficult to see how more posts will solve the problem of management if there are still antiquated and complex procedures both in the commission and council for dealing with the many programmes . 
mrs schreyer came forward with an interesting suggestion which we should consider about the idea of a performance reserve in category 5, so that some posts would be available and we could then give more as the process improves . 
on the contrary , we must work for a parliament which campaigns for openness , efficiency and effective democratic control of the european institutions . 
my own group is satisfied that strict budgetary discipline was adhered to in the drafting of the budget . 
however , just eur 1 850 million were set aside for the development of this region at berlin , while eur 4 500 million were spent during the previous period . 
the council reduced funds for the balkans by eur 200 million , although there is a massive amount of reconstruction work to be done in the wake of the nato bombing . 
in view of the pressing problems we face in serbia and kosovo , we do not believe this strategy to have any serious political intention . 
it is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the community severely to the test . 
financing is a balancing act between need. financial requirements in the new member states and financing opportunities for the donor countrie. and there are limited public funds . 
naturally there is a need to budget carefully , we support this and should not try to get round it . 
we are also aware that many projects and programmes are discredited owing to mismanagement . 
we urgently need a long - and medium - term strategy , so that important areas such as meda and the stability pact for the balkans are not played off against each other . 
we fear that the flexibility reserve is probably not being used to finance meda , as it should be , but instead , is being employed , at the end of the day , to offset further financial need in serbia . 
the european union no longer has any alibi since the fall of milosevic . 
the policy of aid for the balkans must now concentrate massively on serbia , a region impoverished by our bombing raids last year and by our economic sanctions which hit it so hard . 
the aid we propose to contribute must safeguard rather than threaten the serbian national identity . 
we should , therefore , remember that both kosovo and montenegro form an integral part of the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
let us therefore put an end to direct aid to these province. occasionally without a legal basis , as we saw in this chamber not so long ago in the case of montenegr. direct aid that serves primarily to fuel the separatist movements . 
in conclusion , we must clearly remember that , as far as we are concerned , aid for the balkans in no way justifies requests for revision of the financial perspective . 
the bottom line of every budget year shows a surplus , indicating that the amounts of appropriations we have voted on do not correspond to the real needs of the situation . 
but in that case , unfortunately , there are many examples : special treatment given to associations with declared federalist aims or to the many ngos whose roles , philosophies and operations are highly questionable , the funding of european political parties , via the sums swallowed up in the prince programme , in an attempt to convince the citizens of member states of the validity of the euro at a time when the european currency is experiencing a loss of confidence widely shared by europeans , from our danish friends right up to the managers of the european central bank . 
although the rapporteur attended the meeting of the committee on budgets yesterday , she failed to draw lessons from the credit transfers which were being discussed . 
we must give the commission the opportunity to eliminate the backlog by increasing its staffing levels . 
it is a fact that the unemployment rate is too high in europe , particularly as this affects the weak members of society , i.e. young people , women and the long - term unemployed . 
we must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium - sized enterprises . 
we need more entrepreneurs in europe , who , in their turn , will create more jobs . 
there should be no question of europe failing to keep the promises it makes . 
the level of budgetary implementation ; 
having said that , to make matters clear , reinforced cooperation does not mean a two - speed europe . 
we have specifically stressed that an open and inclusive approach was needed , and no one should be afraid of reinforced cooperation . 
the ' small countries ' , for example , to use a quite inappropriate term , should not feel themselves excluded from reinforced cooperation or that reinforced cooperation means some sort of exclusive vanguard , centre of gravity or pioneer group . 
no one must feel as if they are in a carriage being towed along by a kind of runaway train . 
this is not some sort of directory . 
this question makes me smile a little . 
in my opinion , ambassadors are quite simply there to represent the government of their country . 
they must , of course , pass local information back to their government , but the question here was to find a solution to a situation where fourteen member states had taken measures with regard to the fifteenth for the political reasons that are familiar to you . 
question no 5 by ( h - 0776 / 00 ) : 
subject : violation of human rights and dismantling of paramilitary groups in colombiaparamilitary groups have stepped up the murders of farmers , journalists , trade unionists , political leaders and human rights activists over the past few months . 
ramiro zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and , recently , the colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups ' " plan 100 " to kill one hundred human rights activists . 
the government has recognised the " accidental " killing of six children in puerto rico on 15 august . 
furthermore , colombia has not assembled the units that the european union asked it to create to fight the paramilitaries . 
what measures is the council taking or prepared to take to make aid to colombia conditional on the colombian government showing significant progress in respect for human rights and in firm action towards dismantling the paramilitary groups ? 
yes , generally the european union regularly condemns in the strongest possible terms the serious human rights violations which , unfortunately , are still being committed practically every day in colombia . 
the matter to which mr mccartin refers , however , has not been specifically referred to the council , and the council has not mentioned the matter as such in its discussions . 
the european union has also appealed for the commitment of all parties to seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict , without which it would be impossible to establish any lasting peace . 
it is up to the colombian authorities to define the practical means by which the colombian government might undertake to dismantle the paramilitary groups . 
recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means . 
thank you for the information , mr president , and thank you for giving me the floor . 
many of us believe that the problems in colombia , as in other latin american countries , stem from the issue of whether or not peasant - farmers own land . 
in 1984, 0.2 % of landowners in colombia owned 32 % of the land . 
in 1997, this figure stood at 45 % , and today will be even higher . 
when mr moscovici answers mr de rossa that he is sensitive to what he says , why is it that when the general affairs council on 9 october particularly referred to a european plan for colombia , the european commission subsequently issued a communication on 18 october which uses the words " plan colombia " , with its military aid and with its aerial spraying of crops which have been condemned by the panamanian interior minister , winston spadafora , the venezuelan minister , josé vicente rangel and governments in peru , equator and brazil ? 
will he today repeat that the council will not support plan colombia , as mr de rossa and i and every civilised member of this house want ? 
i think i have already answered this question . 
the council is not here to make comments on every aspect of this extremely sensitive and painful issue . 
with your permission , mr president , i shall confine myself to the answers i have already given . 
it is the duty of the president of the sitting to guide and interpret the questions and it is then at the discretion of the president - in - office of the council how to discuss or respond to them , except where the questions are nonsensical or have nothing to do with the subject . 
then i will exercise my responsibility . 
mr de rossa has the floor on a point of order . 
the questions that i and other members asked are very specifically related to the situation in colombia . 
it is not adequate to say that you are not in a position , and it is not your role , to go into this kind of detail . 
the question asks you to go into detail . 
why accept the question at all if you are not going to go into the detail ? 
mr de rossa , i have to tell you that the rules of procedure do not allow for responses from members , but merely their questions . 
afterwards you may deal bilaterally with the president - in - office of the council , either in writing or in person . 
i specifically state. and this will have been noted in the minute. that the incident you refer to in your question has not been specifically referred to the council and that the council has not mentioned the matter as such in this debate . 
i had , therefore , answered your question . 
i should not like you to think that the council does not answer the questions asked of it . 
no , i shall try not to give you too academic an answer , but you put me in a difficult position in asking me these questions because we could easily spend more than one evening answering , and in any case we shall no doubt be overrunning the allotted hour with the questions that are coming up . 
this matter raises questions of the objectives to be pursued , and questions of philosophy , of convictions and of analysis . 
indeed everyone applies their own convictions and their own analysis in expressing their views on this subject . 
i should just like to say , once again , speaking on behalf of the council , that the council is perfectly aware of topical events and the importance of these issues . 
the creation of a tobin tax is an attractive option , one championed by many members on both the left and right wing , by a variety of political and non - political organisations , non - governmental organisations , university groups . 
i shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question . 
firstly , i think everyone recognises that this tax , known as tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level . 
it must be noted , however , that while it may be possible to seek a consensus within the european union , no such consensus exists within g7, especially within the oecd , regarding levying a tax on exchange transactions . 
we are even aware , and this is an economic line of reasoning , that if there were a broad consensus , then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory . 
the question that i must ask those who advocate the tobin tax , therefore , is exactly how we can offset that risk that would exist that speculative activities would shift location to tax havens , since this is a phenomenon which must be avoided if such a tax were to be adopted . 
i should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets , particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50 % . 
there would , besides , be a risk of this tax being bypassed due to the high level of innovative performance in the modern financial world . 
the real question i have , then , does not concern the objectives of the tobin tax , i.e. regulation of the exchange markets , making these markets more ethical by using them to fund development , but rather on our ability to ensure that these mechanisms are effective . 
once again , this does not indicate my opposition in principle to the idea , as i am not opposed to it , certainly on a personal basis . 
at the recent meetings in prague , and at the meetings of the g7 and the international monetary and financial committee ( imfc ) , in its capacity as presidency of the european union , france proposed focuses for reform intended to provide a response to the concerns behind the , now old , proposal of establishing a tobin - type tax . 
the communiqués of the g7, the imfc and the statements of the imf director - general , mr köhler , moreover reflect the sympathies that exist in relation to the policy guidelines promoted by france , particularly as regards ordered financial liberalisation and combating money laundering . 
it will all depend on its level , but there are a number of possible strategies and i agree completely with you that the objective of funding is secondary to the objective of combating speculation . 
the thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation . 
the minor amount you mention is precisely in the same order as the daily variations in the euro / dollar exchange rate , and this is something we are attempting to combat by other , infinitely more costly methods . 
further to the comment which danielle auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the south , i would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures , for instance , a range between usd 50 and 250 billion , which could be recovered by a tobin - type tax , whereas , at the same time , the undp [ united nations development programme ] amounts to usd 40 billion per annum , which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world . 
once again , i am anxious to curtail the philosophical , ideological and political elements of my answer . 
as for the rest , i should just like to add that france has indeed looked into a number of areas of reform with a view to answering the concerns behind the proposal to establish a tobin - type tax , even if questions of how it is actually going to work remain unanswered . 
i do agree with you , however , we could be discussing this for a long time to come . 
question no 15 by ( h - 0729 / 00 ) : 
subject : spread of bseit appears that bse is more contagious than was generally thought and that several other animal species can carry the disease . 
in recent months the disease has been detected , inter alia , in various areas of france . 
the council is actively involved in examining the commission proposal and these amendments with a view to managing in the near future to issue a position on this . 
moreover , in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in june 2000, in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer . 
i should not like to get into this very acrimonious debate or to get involved in bilateral french - british considerations . 
i think this is not the right place and i am not the right person to discuss such matters . 
mrs isler béguin will pardon me if i do not wish to go into great detail in response to a debate on bse which has a justifiable place in this house after entering into a debate on the tobin tax . 
i do not have any information other than that i have already given you . 
i shall refrain from commenting on press articles concerning community documents with which i am not familiar at the present time . 
as usual , however , i can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us . 
mr president , on a point of order would it be possible to reinstate question no 2 ? 
i was at a foreign affairs meeting when this question came up . 
unfortunately i had no prior notice that it was coming up because i have been in sri lanka for the last month heading an eu mission to observe the elections . 
i beg your indulgence to hear the answer please . 
i must tell you , mr cushnahan , that the document is distributed to all members in their pigeonholes and that the secretariat of each political group receives them on mondays . 
will the council undertake to extend the existing ban to all vessels , whatever country they come from , and to introduce binding measures to protect the marine environment ? 
excellent question . 
thank you for asking . 
that concludes question time . 
i therefore believe that , in principle , we ought to support the commission proposals for revising their staffing policy . 
i hope , mr president , and this is my concluding remark , that we are at least going to cut the eur 50 million budget lines financing the israel - plo peace agreement . 
therefore , in the european parliament , we will propose new measures , not so much aimed at seeking new fundin. which we already know cannot be implemented under current condition. but at establishing new institutional commitments that will improve the quality of spending and ensure that not a single euro is wasted . 
and you , commissioner , will have to revise the commitology agreement , even if it seems impossible . 
the efforts of the rapporteur , mrs haug , to incorporate the suggestions of our group on that subject deserve a great deal of gratitude . 
we should recognise that she is being a very reasonable rapporteur and that she is seeking consensus . 
in the medium term we will see the importance of the decisions that parliament is beginning to take today . 
it is true that , if the council took an intransigent position , it would make things difficult in such important areas as the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for meda , the management committees , increases in payments in order to absorb the remainder that needs to be paid or the extension of the n + 2 planning procedure to external actions . 
if the council took a flexible position , we could reach an agreement at second reading in order to close the budget . 
it is designed to obscure rather than enlighten and i have been disappointed by the attitude adopted today with respect to activity - based budgeting . 
but of course it is not enough to encourage reform in each institution separately . 
real savings can only be made if the institutions work together . 
the educational aspect lies in the fact that we shall all be better able to see what we are getting for our money . 
as elected representatives , we are of course delighted with any move to make the budget more easily understandable . 
this spring , commissioner chris patten illustrated this by asking why the eu was appropriating more money to cleaning up after hurricane mitch in latin america than it had appropriated to developing the russian economy . 
that is the sort of question we must ask ourselves when we study the budget , for it is of course questions of this kind that our voters will quite rightly be asking . 
with the new format , it has therefore become easier to understand and take in the whole picture , but the new activity - based budgeting must also mirror the reform process whereby the commission establishes a simplified form of administration involving delegation and a clearer allocation of responsibility , and this is of course something more difficult to achieve . 
there are major organisational changes under way , and there is a need for a new culture involving both a genuine desire to accept responsibility for implementing the individual parts of the budget and acceptance of the fact that there are consequences if the responsibility is not fulfilled . 
i wish the commission every possible success in these endeavours . 
these are important topics , but the topic which deserves most attention of all is , of course , foreign policy . 
there is a great need for eu aid in both the applicant countries in the third world and in the balkans . 
in the middle of the budget procedure , the happy day arrived and milosevic had to step aside , and the many promises of economic aid to serbia must now be fulfilled . 
all of u. the council , parliament and the commissio. agree that we must be thrifty , and we have all kept dutifully below the established ceiling for expenditure . 
so the discussion about how we are to obtain the money for serbia does not have to do with any unwillingness to remain within a financial framework . 
i do not think our electorate will appreciate technical justifications in terms of the budget for the fact that we cannot in harmony find the money for serbia and the balkans without reducing our efforts in other countries . 
the nato war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake . 
i would particularly emphasise that we must accept responsibility for the fate of everyone in the country , including more than 500 000 refugees in the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
no other country has accepted so many refugees . 
parliament is now being called upon to ensure that restraint is exercised in areas of social policy and to restrict funds for development policy at a time of increasing world poverty . 
unless a different budget policy is pursued , the very accession of these states will cause the poverty line to run still more deeply in europe . 
what is needed are neither speeches nor explanations , but practical and social action on the part of a european union now acting as a single unit and in which parliament is required to make its own contribution . 
i welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate and to dwell on the importance of the agricultural budget and its relevance not just to farmers but to society in general . 
those with an interest in developing a sustainable agricultural sector will be aware that the central thrust of recent reform as agreed in berlin is a continuing move from commodity support to direct income support for farmers . 
so it is both a social and an economic measure and it is designed to bring prices into line with world trade , while at the same time attempting to retain the european model based on family farming . 
a point not always made is that this sizeable budget provision is not just confined to support for farmers but is also a factor in the provision of cheap food for european citizens . 
in some areas of agricultural activity , such as bee production , eu support represents the profit margin which in effect means consumers enjoy a quality food product at production costs and regretfully , as demonstrated in recent years , sometimes below the cost of production . 
a budget is always more than a mere juggling with figures . 
behind each figure , behind each budget line , behind each allocation , there is a policy to be adopted , there are political goals , huge expectations and , more than anything , people . 
i was able to experience this first - hand over the past two weeks when , during a trip in the western balkans , i visited kosovo and bosnia . 
and i happened to be in pristina when president kostunica was welcomed in biarritz with the necessary pomp and circumstance and was handed eur 200 million in the form of winter aid there and then , no strings attached . 
ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , that was a political act which was not particularly received well by the albanian kosovars . 
a reduction in the financial resources translates in less stability in the western balkans . 
i therefore back all efforts , together with mr lagendijk , to inject maximum funds in the western balkans . 
if necessary , category four should be broken down in our view and the financial perspective should be reviewed . 
ladies and gentlemen , i do not want to see europe remain a political dwarf and i certainly do not want another war in the western balkans , at less than 1 500 km from here . 
it was not the farmers and the poor in the mediterranean who decided and went ahead with the nato bombings , but it is they who are paying for the damage . 
the damage in the balkans needs to be restored , but it should be paid by for those who were responsible for it . 
this budget is unacceptable . 
the european parliament has just one way of showing that it has self - respect and respect for the people in the member states and that is to accept the amendment tabled by our group and reject the entire budget . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i only want to express an opinion on a part of this budget , namely that relating to serbia . 
in the second place , it has been ruined by the sanctions imposed upon the country because of milosevic and , to a small degree , by the nato bombings . 
it is incredible that a country which formerly exported food can now no longer feed its people . 
winter is coming , and there is a shortage of gas , oil and heating equipment . 
political stability depends upon the improvement of living conditions . 
to put it simply : the people of serbia ought neither to freeze nor to go hungry this winter . 
that is why i most particularly welcome the fact that our fellow meps from the committee on budgets have made every effort to provide the emergency aid of eur 200 million for this year , mr modrow , and not for next year , there still being two and a half months of this year left . 
with these funds , we could show that europe is the real partner in this region . 
the fact that it has today , at the same time , been decided to give eur 175 million to poverty - stricken kosovo shows that we do not forget the old challenges when new ones arise . 
this is something that has been repeated . 
there have always been a great deal of problems with payments . 
i want to say very clearly that , with regard to category 4, we on the one hand stand by the international political commitments which have been entered into and accept the new challenges . 
for us , however , it is crucial that , on 15 november , the commission should submi. as we shall demand that it d. a clear , detailed and intelligible report on how we are dealing with the commitments entered into so far and with the total arrears in payments . 
i strongly advise the commission to produce a thorough report so that we do not have to return to this problem area over the next few years . 
until these figures are available , there will be problems in releasing the general implementation reserve of some eur 650 million . 
mr president , unlike mr bourlanges , i am not frustrated by this procedure but i must say that this must be the most mind - numbing budget i have known in the committee on budgets for years . 
whilst there are so many underlying problems , there is relatively little evidence of this in this house , which might be unfortunate . 
in any case , not a great deal has happened . 
there is , of course , one crucial event , namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it , but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this , partly because the council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes . 
we are talking about an increase of more than six per cent , both for payments and commitments . 
at the council meeting ( budget ) , which takes place at the end of november , initiatives ought , in my opinion , to be taken to produce a significantly lower rate of increase for category 1 . 
if the council does this , it will also be more credible in coming back to parliament with a demand for corresponding measures to be taken . 
prioritising is important in all budget work . 
by adopting the necessary priorities in the budget , we shall tackle both of these historic commitments successfully . 
as i see it , we shall be able to do this within the framework of the financial perspective backed by the european parliament . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i join in congratulating all the rapporteurs . 
it is only right to highlight the efforts that the general rapporteur , mrs haug , has made in seeking an intelligent consensus , which i hope will not be frustrated . 
but i would like to focus my comments on the ecsc operating budget , which needs to be examined in the light of the fact that we are on the threshold of the expiry of the treaty . 
its final amount is modest and correct . 
our group relates the strategy for the general budget to the quality of spending and efficient management , and this also extends to the ecsc budget . 
i share the concerns and opinions that the rapporteur , mrs rühle , mentioned this afternoon regarding the sections on research and social measures . 
you only have to look at the amount entered coming from commitments that have not been implemented . 
this is not very serious with the expiry of the treaty very close on the horizon , but it would be worrying if the post - ecsc legal framework maintained the possibility of prolonging such practices . 
we are therefore paying close attention to the proposal for a decision on the financial consequences of the expiry of the treaty . 
the commission will have to look at a transparent mechanism so that the european financial institutions can , at the correct time , evaluate what is remaining from the ecsc and be protected from any possible failures to pay by debtors and so that , through a system of public competition , maximum profitability can be achieved . 
mr president , one of the great privileges of parliamentarians is to talk about the budget . 
that leads to my third remark on what now faces us . 
1999 / 0153 ( cod ) ) 
mr president , in countries with a high level of technological development , the protection of privacy is always more at risk , and therefore appropriate safeguards must be established . 
the countries of the european union are at the vanguard in the protection of privacy compared to systems adopted in other parts of the world , especially those countries which have implemented the two directives , directive 95 / 46 and directive 97 / 6. on the protection of individuals with regard to the protection of personal data . 
the european model considers the protection of personal data to be a fundamental right guaranteed by legally binding rules , based on the principle of peoples ' self - determination of data , that is the principle whereby everyone must be able to decide whether and how personal data concerning him can be collected and used . 
in this model , respect for standards and procedures is guaranteed by an independent authority and final jurisdiction lies with the judges . 
therefore , a rule laying down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning him , which must be processed fairly for specific purposes on the basis of the consent of the person concerned and subject to control by an independent authority , has been included in article 8 of the draft charter of fundamental rights of the european union . 
moreover , article 286 of the treaty establishing the european communities , introduced by the treaty of amsterdam , lays down that community acts on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of dat. that is the two above - mentioned directive. apply to the institutions and community bodies and that an independent supervisory body responsible for monitoring the application of such community acts must be established . 
the proposal for a regulation which is being examined by parliament today implements these provisions , transposes the community legislation and establishes the office of european data protection supervisor , thereby providing appropriate , tangible guarantees of this fundamental right . 
over months of work and with the constant assistance of the commission , we have attempte. and we can inform you that we have been successfu. to produce a detailed regulation responding to the concerns voiced by the council and by the parliamentary committees responsible for assessing the regulation and formulating opinions . 
the willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which , it is my fervent hope , will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading . 
acceptable solutions have therefore been reached , for example regarding the appointment of the european supervisor and the assistant supervisor , which is to be agreed by parliament and the council from lists of names drawn up by the commission following a call for candidates . 
with the unanimous support of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , your rapporteur nevertheless insists upon certain amendments which , for example offer a novel solution to the much - debated subject of the scope of the regulation . 
it is restricted to the community context but a form of protection is provided for in respect of the activities of the institutions outside the first pillar ; this solution is obtained by referring to the rules for the protection of privacy relating to the right of access to documents , governed by article 225 of the treaty establishing the european communities . 
data protection on the telecommunications network ought also to be reviewed . 
we are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied . 
the european parliament is the only body which can democratically supervise decisions by means of the committee procedure which exists . 
in my opinion , it is clear that we would be closing our eyes to the problem if we set up an authority of this type to cover just the community area , while the main problems arise and will , in future , arise due to third pillar bodies too . 
are you aware , for instance , that the schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens , and that europol , whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded , has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen member states , all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly . 
the report which we are to adopt does not reflect this ambition . 
the scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar , i.e. to article 286 . 
the second and third pillars will not be covered by this regulation and will therefore remain impenetrable , to the detriment of citizens ' basic fundamental rights . 
in addition to the restrictive reading of article 286, however , it would have been possible to take article 255 of the treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation . 
indeed mrs paciotti attempted to do so by including a reference to this article in article 12 of the regulation , but the council refused to entertain this possibility . 
there are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable . 
in the end , though , our rapporteur is well aware of these problems and is anxious not to add another two years to the existing backlog . 
we shall therefore offer her our support , in spite of everything , in the hope that the council and , in particular , the commission will be careful not to take advantage of the weaknesses of the text in order to attempt to make nonsense of it . 
they must , furthermore , seek to implement means for the protection of personal data in the second and third pillars too at the earliest possible opportunity . 
it is dangerous , in any case , to allow bodies such as europol or the schengen system to develop without parliamentary or judicial control . 
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report . 
effectively , the problem arises from the exclusions and exceptions in the protection of personal data with regard to the second and , in particular , third , pillars , but also from the exceptions already laid down by the directives as regards police activities and activities related to national security . 
like mrs boudemiene - thiery , i feel that these activities give the greatest cause for concern in terms of citizens ' privacy . 
in my opinion , the rapporteur has done everything feasible to extend the possibility , at least of cooperating and probably of exerting influence on this matter , and so we fully support her report . 
having said that , i would like to take advantage of the fact that the commissioner is here to say that it would appear appropriate to concern ourselves not only with protecting citizens in respect of new technologies but also with the use of these technologies to increase the european citizens ' means of intervening and interacting with the european institutions . 
i feel that other directives should be applied , in a similar way to the directives on privacy in the context of the community institutions , such as the directive on electronic signatures , in order to allow the citizen to interact telematically with the institutions as well , by means of petitions , appeals to the ombudsman , competitions and appeals to the court of justice . 
this would increase the channels for protecting the citizen. an extremely important elemen. but also make it easier for them to act , to be active and to interact with the institutions . 
the commission would first and foremost like to highlight the commitment we made to the citizens of europe to ensure protection of the personal data processed by the institutions of europe . 
we are approximately two years behind schedule in relation to the date set in article 286 of the treaty establishing the european communities , hence the urgent need to reach agreement on this matter . 
the council , with the crucial encouragement of the presidency , succeeded in overcoming the problems raised by a number of delegations , to ensure that the proposal for a regulation will most probably enjoy the unanimous approval of the council . 
the european parliament , in turn , demonstrated great determination in order to enable a decision to be made at first reading , and i should like to express my appreciation and my thanks to your rapporteur , mrs paciotti , who has spared no effort , with the support of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , to ease the path of this agreement . 
by taking the council proposal as a starting point and encouraging that a solution acceptable to all three institutions regarding the scope of the regulation be adopted , mrs paciotti has to a great extent made the way clear for agreement at first reading . 
the commission has , in turn , also played a part in initiating and mediating between the council and parliament . 
the commission also decided not to hold up the adoption of an instrument that is significant for the protection of citizens ' personal data . 
even though it considers that the outcome is not completely satisfactory as far as it is concerned , the commission in turn decided to adopt the text produced as a result of the discussions in the council and parliament as reflected in the paciotti report , and will therefore reject any other amendments to its original proposal . 
amendments nos 1, 2, 4 to 10, 12 to 40, 42 to 54, 57, 58 and 60 to 64 reflect the council text on the points to which the commission can give its assent . 
these amendments are therefore acceptable . 
amendment nos 55, 56 and 59 differ from the council text , but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the council presidency . 
since the commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text , it will accept these amendments . 
amendments nos 3 and 11 differ from the council text , but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the council presidency . 
the commission supports this amendment , and i should like to thank mrs paciotti for tabling it . 
the european data protection supervisor will in fact play a leading role in community institutions ' respecting the provisions protecting citizens ' personal data . 
it goes without saying , then , that his opinion on the legislative proposals to do with the protection of personal data will be very valuable insofar as it will be a major contribution to the legislative debate between institutions . 
it goes without saying , moreover , that the commission , in framing such legislative proposals , must be free to make the appropriate proposal at the time it thinks right . 
amendment no 69 would seem to be acceptable to the commission inasmuch as the wording does not entail a challenge to its right of initiative . 
the commission , therefore , understands this amendment as obliging it to consult the european data protection supervisor after adopting its proposal . 
. ( fr ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me first of all thank the members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism whose comments and amendments have contributed towards enhancing the report which i am presenting this evening . 
the present and future fate of the seven european regions most remote from the continent has given our committee the opportunity to unanimously adopt a constructive and balanced document , the product of lengthy consultation . 
the azores , the canaries , guadeloupe , french guiana , madeira , martinique and réunion form a separate category whose uniqueness has now been recognised by the treaty of amsterdam on the basis of an innovative concept : they are defined as ' outermost regions ' . 
the treaty recognises that the outermost regions have a difficult economic and social situation , aggravated by special handicaps which , because they are continual and combined , are extremely prejudicial to development in these regions . 
this is the reason why it is essential to ensure the widest possible application of the current rules and to use the most appropriate instruments to solve the practical problems faced by these regions and , where necessary , derogations adapted to the regional situation , without this posing any serious threat to community interests . 
the report published by the european commission on 14 march 2000 is not , strictly speaking , a response to the demands of national and regional authorities in the outermost regions . 
the commission specifies that it is unable to provide answers to all the questions ; it often confines itself to proposing guidelines intended to continue and consolidate certain established instruments and further reserves the option of looking into the problems on a case by case basis . 
article 299 ( 2 ) primarily expresses a political will , supported on repeated occasions by the european council and , today , by the european parliament . 
the chief objective of my report was to remind the european commission of this political will in order to put an end to the unfortunate impression of reluctance or inertia that we are currently getting from the commission . 
as a matter of urgency , therefore , the staff complement of the interdepartmental group attached to the commission secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied , when considered by the college of commissioners and on the basis of article 299 ( 2 ) , by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact . 
my report urges the commission to prepare a genuine multiannual work programme , accompanied by a detailed timetable , giving the most comprehensive details possible of the measures planned , and providing all the essential guarantees concerning the provision of the resources required to ensure the viability of the measures and to ensure that the measures concerned are taken on a long - term basis where they are intended to deal with intrinsic handicaps . 
in response to the commission , my report specifically investigates a number of areas falling within the scope of activities of the european union . i shall give just a brief overview of these this evening . 
the commission has acknowledged that the agricultural and fisheries measures need to be revised or upgraded . 
however , this second revision of the posei regulations will take place in a very difficult budgetary climate which may have a major bearing on the substance of the programmes , particularly the level of aid granted . 
by way of example , in its draft budget for 2001, the commission has proposed an outrageous cut in the budget for implementation of posei , giving rise to an acute sense of disquiet among the many agricultural producers in the outermost regions , on whose behalf i am speaking before you today . 
in addition , we need optimum coordination and use of all the instruments available at community level , in particular the structural funds , state aid schemes and tax and customs policies . 
the success of the new community policy to assist the outermost regions calls for action geared to the strategic areas of the world economy : transport , energy , the environment , the information society , research and technological development . 
in this way it will contribute to promoting economic and social progress thanks to an increased level of employment . 
the geographical situation and island status of the outermost regions must enable them to become active frontiers of the european union . 
moreover , there is an urgent need to initiate an analysis of the impact of the new acp - eu partnership agreement , signed in june 2000 in cotonou , and other international trade agreements with a view to assessing their repercussions for the outermost regions and drawing up measures to compensate producers in those regions liable to face additional competition which they are unable to withstand . 
to conclude , finally , with a subject that has a bearing on our immediate future , the process of enlargement is unquestionably an essential element in the construction of europe , but an evaluation of its implications must be undertaken as a matter of urgency as of right now in order to prevent the aid duly allotted to the outermost regions and the projects resulting from the implementation of article 299 ( 2 ) being brought into question . 
mr president , the rapporteur , mrs sudre , has done a good job on her report on the outermost regions . 
on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , i would like to thank her for the way that she took on board our amendments and points of view , both in the spirit and in the actual text of the report . 
from the point of view of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , what i would like to point out is that , in actual fact , we can only treat equally what is equal . 
it is an attempt to establish an entirely uniform legal order for these outermost regions , which are separated from the rest of community territory , from mainland europe , by thousands of kilometres , and which are divided into small island regions with very difficult conditions for raising capital and for transport , which prevent the general rules for competition in the regions from being applied . 
only through a general derogation in favour of the outermost regions will companies located in those regions be on an equal footing with companies located on mainland europe . 
when regions are so distanced from the continental nucleus , trying to automatically apply the tax and customs rules that are applied in the continental nucleus would mean putting those outermost regions at a disadvantage . 
on the other hand , some significant points in the opinion do not figure in the final version of the resolution . 
given the importance of fisheries to the outermost regions , i can only be saddened by this . 
i appreciate that differences of perspective mean that it will not always be possible to reconcile views expressed in the lead committee and other committees . 
my concern is rather that we do not currently have any standardised mechanism for making an attempt to do so . 
i am asking , therefore , whether the president of parliament would be prepared to look at ways in which improvements could be made , for example , by consultations prior to voting or by adjusting the order in which votes are taken . 
without such improvements , we risk losing the benefits of a great deal of expertise , not just to our own detriment , but also to the detriment of those we seek to serve . 
in the meantime , and on this particular report , i would respectfully request both the council and the commission to look at the conclusions that are not contained in the motion for a resolution , as well as the ones that are . 
mr president , for the european union this is simply one more debate of the many that we hold . 
for the outermost regions this is the most important debate that the european parliament can hold concerning them . 
in fact , what we say here today and how we vote tomorrow will be front - page news in the seven outermost regions , and the news reports on the regional television channels will report extensively on what we say and decide here . 
for many europeans , some outermost regions are nothing more than a holiday destination on the map . 
this may even be the view of some of our fellow meps of the outermost regions . 
for those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions , this is a very negative view , and , of course , a deeply mistaken one . 
behind this idea , beyond our landscape and an exceptional climate , is the social and economic reality of regions that are among the least developed in the european union , with the highest levels of unemployment and with huge structural problems that impede our development . 
for more than a decade the european commission has been aware of our problems and our particular characteristics . 
this is the first debate that the plenary session of the european parliament has held about our regions since the treaty of amsterdam included a new article on them . 
so far , since an interdepartmental group was set up for the outermost regions under the presidency of mr delors , we have travelled a long and fruitful road , and i must express the deepest gratitude of the europeans from the outermost regions to those who have presided over that group . 
the commission document for implementing paragraph 2 of article 299 of the ec treaty is a good document , and our rapporteur , mrs sudre , has done well today by offering us an excellent report . 
with this article and with the measures taken in order to implement it , we have a legal basis that until now we were lacking , and a good tool for our development . 
mrs sudre has succeeded in putting together a balanced report that includes many of the amendment. more than 100 of the. which were tabled for the initial draft report . 
one of these amendments proposes the implementation and application of the policies of the financial instrument for fisheries . 
the outermost regions bring atlantic , american and african dimensions to europe , which enrich our cultural , political and economic diversity , of which we are all rightly proud . 
mr president , commissioner , mrs sudre , we must bear in mind that the opportunity for us to debate here in this house today on the subject of the outermost regions is the result of a process of slow maturation . 
the fact is , even though , as early as the treaty of rome , reference was made to the french overseas departments , we had to wait until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of these regions , the notorious posei programmes , for the european union to at long last acknowledge that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps affecting the outermost regions justified special treatment in comparison with the other regions of the community . 
eight years later , the treaty of amsterdam with its article 299 ( 2 ) , the subject of our discussion today , gave rise to the hope that one day the terms ' growth ' and ' employment ' would mean the same thing throughout all european territory . 
so , it has been a long wait , and the hopes expressed by our peoples have built up throughout this long wait . 
i therefore feel entitled to confess that i felt rather disappointed when i read the commission communication . 
ladies and gentlemen , the time for stating good intentions is behind us , what we need is practical action and we need it now . 
we need a specific timetable , one that will be respected . 
we need real financial commitments , not , as we have in the 2001 budget , posei appropriations that , at the moment , have been cut by 25 % . 
most especially we need guarantees that this action will continue in the long term , because the handicaps of these regions , as listed in article 299 ( 2. remoteness , insularity , small size , difficult climat. are not about to disappear . 
i am therefore pleased that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has adopted a bold and ambitious stance on state aid , tax schemes and the implications of enlargement . 
i am pleased to see that the committee has adopted the bulk of the amendment i tabled . 
i should , moreover , like to pay tribute , at this point , to the rapporteur , mrs sudre , for her open - mindedness and her consultative approach , which made it possible , with everyone joining forces , to successfully complete a report which offers our regions real hope . 
indeed i am convinced that the young people of our regions can actually glimpse a way out of the tragic unemployment which so drives them to despair , if we do manage to shift from a basically financial strategy , necessary , admittedly , but inadequate , to a more comprehensive strategy based on real recognition of our unique characteristics . 
ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , the outermost regions are already the very emblem of the diversity , and hence the wealth of the european union . 
tomorrow they may become a laboratory providing the finest illustration of the effectiveness of the experiment of the european social model . 
since the economy of the outermost regions is classed in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty itself as being dependent on a single product or on a limited range of products , we must provide incentives for potential diversification and , at the same time , create better conditions for producing what people actually have the means and the ability to produce . 
what cannot , under any circumstances , be allowed to happen is that we help to eradicate the few comparative advantages that we have . 
in the azores , our main product is milk . 
if we are to take article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty seriously , i can only hope for an improvement in our framework for producing what we actually have the means and the ability to produce . 
the outermost regions and the citizens who live there have high hopes for the european institutions ' action in implementing article 299 ( 2 ) . 
mr president , i would first like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs sudre . 
i think that she has done a magnificent job and also that she has shown imagination , calm and a capacity to reach agreements and compromises in order to present a document to this parliament and to the commission which i think can be useful and effective . 
commissioner , i think that you are perfectly aware of , and sensitive to , these issues , due to the fact that you come from a region with specific problems . 
there are three regions in europe whose citizens face specific problems : mountain , island and the outermost regions . 
thank you very much , commissioner barnier . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
( the sitting was closed at 12 midnight ) 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed . 
are there any comments ? 
mr president , i would like my name to be added to yesterday 's attendance register . 
i can prove that i was also here for the roll - call vote , but i had not entered my name . 
your name will be included , mrs rothe . 
mr president , i wonder if this might be an appropriate time to mention an issue that arose yesterday during voting time . 
i will , of course , inform the president of what you have said . 
mr president , parallel to that point of order could it be also borne in mind that the interpreters are very kind to us and sometimes they do not translate " my machine failed to work " as " i failed to work " . 
mr president , i rise on a matter concerning the meeting today of the college of commissioners , under rule 38 or 64 . 
the rapporteur , mr bowis , has drawn up a superb report , which highlights the importance of an excellent , independent food authority , which would have responsibility for risk assessment , but not for risk management or crisis management , which must be the competence of the commission , as must legislative proposals . 
both this food authority and the legislative proposals being proposed , which aim to guarantee food safety , will receive the support of this house , commissioner . 
but i would like to draw attention to a fundamental issue : the best possible legislation and an excellent , scientifically unimpeachable food authority are not enough . 
we may have other food crises and , each time this happens , consumer safety will be endangered , as will the credibility of the institutions and the interests of the agricultural sector and the agri - foodstuffs industry . 
we must be certain that the carcasses of bse cows do not end up in the food chain . 
we must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled . 
but that confidence is being shattered time after time . 
the more than eighty measures from the white paper are therefore indispensable . 
setting up the european food safety agency is a major step in the right direction . 
its key task is providing scientific advice , for the discussion on food safety must be pure too . 
emotions run high where food is concerned : against globalisation , large - scale production and genetic modification , and in favour of local produce , tradition and diversity . 
those emotions are often justified , but we must ensure that they do not become a cover for protectionism . 
whilst acknowledging the boom in ready - made food , we must also adopt a pro - active approach . 
the new food must be of quality , the ingredients traceable , and labels must offer honest information . 
consumers deserve a choice . 
the food authority must provide objective information to both consumers and decision makers . 
as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , i would like to highlight a few points . 
decision - making must be clear and transparent . 
as duplication of the work and of scientific research must be avoided , we need to collaborate with national research institutes and the joint research centres . 
we also agree with the commission 's acknowledgement that in the interest of the public , food safety should be given particularly high priority . 
second , the european public are right to demand that their health be given top priority . 
furthermore , they are right to demand that they have an important say , through their parliament , when food and animal feed safety with a view to protecting their health is at stake . 
that is why the envisaged european food safety agency can only have articles 95 and 152 of the ec treaty as its legal basis , with special attention being paid to its powers . 
we must not confuse food risk assessment with questions of product quality . 
we have a stark reminder this week of why we are all here and why this legislation is going through in the report in my own countr. the phillips committee of inquiry into the disaster , indeed scandal , of bse . 
that came about in our national herd because of negligence and the indictment against those responsible , civil servants as well as ministers , will be set out for the world to see tomorrow . 
it will not be a day when we look with any particular pride at the procedures we then had . 
those procedures have now been amended and changed and we have our own food standards agency . 
these things are inextricably linked with what the food authority will be doing . 
finally , we will also be supporting a number of the new amendments , certainly amendments nos 11 - 13, 7 - 9 and we wish to have a free vote on amendment no 14 . 
we consider some of the others superfluous , but generally speaking the broad consensus there has been throughout in this house on this report should be carried through into the vote . 
mr president , mr bowis has done an extraordinary job as rapporteur on this major and complicated issue . 
i should like to repeat this : ensure that the regulations are properly complied with , the length and breadth of the union . 
ladies and gentlemen , this is only the beginning ; we have a long way to go yet . 
as a result , many of the control initiatives which have subsequently been adopted in europe , have originated in other countries , particularly the usa . 
risk assessment must start where the problems starts . 
therefore , if one acknowledges the need for a transnational agency to bolster the efforts of individual agencie. and indeed i d. then any such agency should not only deal with europe : it must have a global reach taking in global information . 
that is precisely what the who does for us : working with its regional organisations in a wholly integrated manner . 
this cannot be achieved by an eu organisation . 
given that the who programme remains properly funded and supported , there would appear to be no need whatsoever for yet another agency , especially one with such a limited reach as the 15 member states of the european union . 
food safety is far too important for it to become yet another excuse for eu integration . 
it displays the very worst of the european union , because the perception is one of control freakery . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the white paper on food safety is a long overdue response to incidents like the bse and dioxin crises , which deeply undermined consumers ' sense of security and destroyed their confidence . 
i particularly want to comment on two points . 
first , the creation of a network amongst europe 's research institutions is absolutely essential if we are to achieve our objective . 
but we need to avoid a situation in which the future european food safety agency and , for example , the food and veterinary office in dublin have overlapping responsibilities and powers . 
not only the commission , but also every member state must be legally able to call upon this agency . 
this makes sense if the european food safety agency is also to be able to operate independently of the commission and if , whenever necessary , it is to take prompt crisis management action . 
however , the conditions for appealing to the agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed . 
second , a universal system for tracing the original ingredients of all food must be created . 
this principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of eu legislation on food labelling is carried out . 
that is the only way to regain consumers ' confidence in food production , which has been destroyed . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur , mr bowis has produced an excellent report , and in many areas i would like to reinforce what he has said . 
establishing an efficient and independent european food safety agency is very much to be welcomed , not least because of the various food scandals to date . 
food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers , because they want to eat healthily , and we have to ensure that this is possible . 
the agency 's central tasks will therefore be risk assessment and risk communication , an early warning system with the assistance of the five food committees all working together , excellent public relations work with consumers on food and food safety issues , and optimum networking with scientific institutions and control agencies in the member states , so as to guarantee controls on the ground from producer to consumer . 
in order to rebuild and strengthen consumer confidence , food safety and regulations need to be taken into account in legislation governing fertilisers , plant health products , medicines , the environment and waste . 
the community is the world 's largest importer and exporter of food . 
this sector has an annual turnover of eur 600 billion and employs 10 million people . 
i support everyone involved , be it in a political , administrative or other capacity , who is working on a " food for all " strategy . 
the developed industrialised nations are also best placed to make the greatest contribution here , through sustainable and varied food production . 
mr president , we value the work carried out by mr bowis because , in addition to placing the subject in the right context , it raises important questions to which solutions must be found in the course of time . 
mr president , rapporteur bowis started his explanatory statement on his report with a quotation from ludwig feuerbach , which he also repeated this morning : " der mensch ist was er isst " ( you are what you eat ) . 
i do not share this viewpoint , for we know that a human being is more than just a body . 
the fact that food safety rules have been around for a long time is evident from the bible , as god prescribed these to his people of israel . 
however , it is appropriate to qualify the concern which people have with regard to food safety . 
i would like to counterbalance the quotation from feuerbach with one from the lord jesus himself : " what goes into the mouth does not make anyone unclean ; it is what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean " , namely what we all say . 
i will not dwell on the heart of the matter , since we are all agreed on that . 
i would like to bring a few minor aspects to the fore . 
i have tabled an amendment which is not unimportant , in my view , although mr whitehead suggested it was redundant . 
the authority must be independent and that is why i think that ' close ties ' , as stated in paragraph 12, should actually not be allowed , not with anybod. not with consumer associations or anybody else . 
i therefore believe that your amendment no 11 and my amendment no 17 are perfectly reconcilable . 
secondly , in addition to the authority , there are a number of important things which need to happen . 
i would single out two of these : we urgently need pcb standards at european level , as well as a positive list of ingredients of animal feed . 
commissioner , i would say that there is no time to lose and , ladies and gentlemen , our role in the european parliament is also vital for , by studying the annual report and interviewing the director of the authority , we will need to ensure that the authority works , because if it does not , if it does not do its work properly , we will end up footing the bill politically speaking . 
i believe that is something which we will need to keep an eye on in the years ahead . 
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for assembling the amendments of all the group. as other members have sai. in the compromise amendments . 
i think he is pursuing an obvious objective which i. as he says in his documen. that of guaranteeing the high levels of food safety that should exist , and a second objective that derives from the first , which is to say that of restoring credibility in the eyes of the consumer , which has been somewhat dented by scandals . 
i would like to remind you of one that occurred in spain , the rape seed oil scanda. the consequences of which are still apparent now , after more than 20 year. but also the bse scandal , the dioxin scandal and the latest worrying scandal in the united states regarding the release , for use in food products , of transgenic sweetcorn that would seem to be unsuitable for consumption . 
i believe the rapporteur 's proposal to act on three levels is very important . 
therefore , as mihail papayannakis said , we too are going to approve and support the report . 
mr president , i would like to join with other colleagues in complimenting the rapporteur , mr bowis for his very constructive and very logical approach to this particular problem . 
may i say , by way of a light note , that when i listened to mr blokland introducing some biblical quotes i felt he had elevated the status of this debate to a new plane because there were times when we thought that nothing short of divine intervention would help us resolve the matter . 
however , having said that , i believe it is to the credit of this parliament and commissioner byrne that food safety now dominates the european agenda . 
the reform of european union food laws would be carried out at the level of the european union . 
for example , gmo foods offer the opportunity to reduce the levels of pesticide residues and improve nutritional quality , it would be negligent to ignore these advantages . 
however , i fully support the introduction of clear , non - technical and standardised labelling in the context of gmo food products . 
moreover , no food products which are genetically modified or contain genetically modified ingredients should be allowed into the food chain until they are fully tested , and only then with clear labelling specifications . 
mr president , the fact that the white paper on food safety has no intrinsic legislative value does not in any way detract from the dual purpose which it undoubtedly serves . 
first of all , it embodies the commitment to completely and comprehensively overhaul legislation , to set up an independent food safety agency and to organise inspection better . 
a second justified emphasis is the request for consideration to be given to regional and cultural differences in the food supply and to the role of the sme and the traditional trades in question . 
i would in this light urge you to recognise the specific value of the sme and traditional trades in the extensive package of legislation . 
a third emphasis is required which is as yet missing from the report but which we can introduce via amendment no 12 . 
both the white paper and the bowis report mention communication on the one hand and procedures in emergency situations on the other , but there is no attention to the internal and external crisis communication which is so desperately needed . 
it can nevertheles. and we have first - hand experience of this in belgiu. be a determining factor in managing the extent of a crisis and in whether consumer confidence in the institutions survives or not . 
to conclude , let us hope that the member states might join in the vision shared by parliament and the commission , and that , above all , they will assume their responsibility , not only as constituent parts of the council , but also as a body which must ensure that inspection in the field is carried out efficiently once the european measures have been transposed in national legislation . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the white paper on food safety has laid a firm basis for better food in future and i am also hopeful of more environmentally - friendly and people - friendly production of food . 
the rapporteur , along with many meps in the committee , including myself , have placed the focus on the food authority and this is regrettable to some extent . 
regrettable , because good food , safe food particularly benefits from clear legislation . 
but i also understand that the many crises in europe , and i also refer to my own country , have shown that we mainly need something to hold on to . 
the policy needs an anchor so that clear choices can be made and the consumer needs to have confidence . 
this is why we need this food authority and this is why we are right to set the necessary store by it . 
it is important for this food authority to be able to function independently . 
we have spelled this out very clearly in the report , and i am absolutely delighted about it . 
it is also important for the food authority to be able to prioritise , to work pro - actively and to make recommendations to those who are responsible for risk management . 
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has now come to adopt a reasonable policy , as there is now the desire to create a scientific , authoritative body from the food safety agency , which would have responsibility for risk assessment and keeping the public informed . 
it is important that risk management itself will continue to be the responsibility of the member states and the commission and thus the object of political supervision also . 
for us to be able to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food and maintain it , the food safety agency must start its work with adequate public resources . 
self - sufficiency and the independence of the unit will serve the interests of european consumers best . 
for our part , we believe that a tax on agro - business profits would be a way of releasing these resources . 
in order to respect the principle of transparency , we must also authorise the referral of cases to the agency by the unions and the various professional associations , in relation to both consumption and ecology . 
sound scientific risk assessment , coupled with an effective strategy of communication with the public , cannot by themselves stamp out the food crises . 
that is something of a technocratic view , which makes the mistake of overlooking the cultural , social and economic dimensions of food . 
we need a stronger political will to resolve certain crises . 
take the current mad cow disease crisis . 
we should be able to ban the incorporation of animal meal in feed and withdraw the licence of food manufacturers who do not respect these rules . 
mr president , i congratulate john bowis on his excellent work . 
i have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report . 
he has withstood the pressures he has come up against in this emotional issue extremely well . 
i would also like to thank commissioner byrne for his cooperation . 
in my opinion , that was a wise policy . 
it is , however , important to define what we expect from the food safety agency and what sort of criteria should apply in selecting its location . 
in the interests of the citizens of the union as a whole , it is to be hoped that these criteria will be implemented . 
they include good reputation in the field of food safety , independence , and good scientific infrastructure incorporating the best available technology and good transport and telecommunications links . 
amendment no 19, which i together with mr nisticò and mr fiori , as well as many others , tabled on behalf of the ppe - de group , states these criteria clearly without taking a stand on any particular location . 
these criteria will all be essential tools in realising the common aim to restore consumer confidence in european food safety as soon as possible . 
in talks , there has been a call for the agency to be located in a city in which one of our institutions is located , as , otherwise , it could not be supervised . 
this sort of argument is puzzling and worrying and in fact removes the foundations on which the idea of integration is built . 
i do not think we can in all seriousness say that only an authorised body that is located in the midst of the community can reliably carry out the task it is entrusted with . 
i myself do not think this way and trust in the strength and basic principles of european integration throughout the eu . 
mr president , i too should like to congratulate mr bowis on the huge effort which he made in his report to take account of everyone 's view and for agreeing that we should also refer to the more general concept of food . 
the white paper on food safety is a proposal which aspires to restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain . 
consumers are quite right to demand food which poses absolutely no threat to their health and the quality of which meets certain criteria and specifications . 
consequently , legislation on food issues should cover the entire spectrum and extend horizontally . 
allow me to highlight a number of points . 
the early warning system has proven to be less than efficient and the member states bear a great deal of the responsibility for this . 
risks therefore need to be identified early , assessed scientifically and nipped in the bud . 
european action is appropriate because in a single market risk does not stop at national borders . 
the efsa should play an important role in the existing rapid alert system , which should be improved and extended to cover all areas of food safety , including animal feed . 
i welcome the fact that there is broad agreement on the main principles : that a new scientific body responsible for food safety risk assessment should be established , that it should be independent , accountable , transparent and subject to the needs of objective research and of commercial confidentiality and that it should provide the public with accessible and comprehensible information . 
most important of all , it should gain the respect of its peers , the confidence of the public and the willingness of member state governments to accept its conclusions . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the white paper on food safety is the commission 's response to the public 's increased sensitivity in this area . 
the limited quantity of food we still allow ourselves must first and foremost be healthy , taste good and be produced in an environmentally sound way in consumers ' eyes . 
there are many aspects that need to be addressed in talking about food safety and if we want to guarantee it . 
there are already very many organisations and institutions , not to mention associations and initiatives , concerned with food safety . 
in the european single market , which implies free trade and movement of goods , we are increasingly faced with the issue of legislative jurisdiction and responsibility for controls in this area , which is so important for the european public . 
the commission is now proposing the creation of a european food safety agency . 
i welcome this proposal , but at the same time i have certain questions about the powers , remit and influence of a european authority . 
its main function is public relations . 
i hope that this will be given due consideration in the new proposal . 
first of all i would like to express my thanks to the many members who have contributed to this report . 
as you are aware , the commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety . 
i must give special thanks to the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and its rapporteur , john bowis , for producing this opinion with such a degree of consensus and pay particular tribute to him and to the other members of this house who have taken the time to discuss these issues with me and with my officials . 
the consequence is that we have achieved this excellent measure of consensus which is yet another notable example of the cooperation that can exist between our two great institutions . 
the commission 's white paper on food safety sets out a major and ambitious programme of legislative reforms to complete the eu 's farm to table policy . 
taken together with our proposals to establish a european food safety agency , the programme will make a major contribution to the health protection of our citizens as well as to the restoration and maintenance of consumer confidence in food safety . 
european consumers have every right to expect the highest achievable food safety standards and our ambition is to develop systems that deliver this . 
a food safety chain from farm to fork , correctly regulated and effectively controlled , is the road to building high levels of confidence in the european food supply . 
in this respect the commission is already hard at work on its programme of legislative reform set out in the white paper . 
several proposals are already before the council and parliament : for example , the package of proposals recasting and updating the hygiene legislation . 
as an aside , i can say of the speakers who referred to the need for sensitivity in relation to the promotion of local food specialities and traditional foods that this issue is addressed in the hygiene legislation . 
we are also working on a number of major reforms in the systems of control implemented by the competent authorities in the member states and at community level . 
in this regard , the commission will adopt proposals for a revised control regime in the period ahead . 
the white paper reiterates the commission 's commitment to basing its proposals for consumer health protection measures on sound science . 
indeed , the food authority is conceived as a point of scientific excellence at the service of the community in its broadest sense : consumers , the institutions and member states alike . 
the food authority will also need to be visible to the general public and be the authoritative voice in matters relating to the scientific aspects of food safety in europe . 
the commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the overarching principles and objectives of food law , which will provide the framework for future health protection measures relating to food . 
this proposal will put forward the establishment of a european food safety agency which will provide the community with advice on scientific and technical issues and thereby enable the commission to give effect to the general principles of food law . 
our intention is to adopt this proposal in the commission on 8 november 2000 . 
this schedule continues to reflect the importance the commission attaches to the matter and is broadly in line with the timescale set out in the white paper which envisages that the establishing legislation will be enacted in 2001, leading to the establishment of the food authority in 2002 . 
i only wish we could do better in terms of time . 
i know , mr president , that you share my views in this regard . 
i look forward to the fullest support from parliament in dealing with this most important piece of legislation in the shortest possible timeframe . 
i have followed parliament 's debate on the white paper with great interest . 
i am encouraged to note the high degree of agreement between parliament 's views as expressed in the draft report that you have debated , and the white paper itself . 
this will facilitate the commission 's task in bringing forward a balanced proposal that takes maximum account of the views of parliament and the many stakeholders in the area of food safety . 
you will appreciate that i cannot promise to take on board all your views , but my record before this parliament will demonstrate that i will do my utmost . 
i have previously acknowledged in parliament and other forums what i regard as an important issue for the fullest acceptance of our ideas for a food authority : the role and involvement of parliament itself in enacting the legislation establishing the food authority . 
this was one of the most rapid agreements to be signed in the history of international agreements : it is the only agreement to have been ratified within a year by forty parliaments , thus becoming operative . 
the most recent meeting in geneva noted considerable progress in the area of de - mining as well as awareness of the issue . 
certainly , much remains to be done , and this is why we must all welcome the commission 's proposal as a positive step . 
moreover , i hope that this capacity to exert pressure and the speed with which the union tackled the issue of anti - personnel landmines might serve as an example for the ratification of other agreements which have always been extremely important to parliament , such as the establishment of the international tribunal for crimes against humanity , not to mention the moratorium on the use of the death penalty . 
turning to our report , i welcome the commission 's proposal as positive , and i have to say that the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy and the committee on development and cooperation have worked extremely hard in order to improve i. if this was possibl. on certain points in particular . 
the final point concerns the amendments . 
i restate my position opposing amendments nos 10 and 19, in the interests of budgetary cohesion and , with regard to amendment no 29, i call for split voting in order to improve the formulation throughout the text , for i feel that it has suffered from some misinterpretation . 
i would like to thank you , mr president , commissioner , and the hope that all these innovative proposals will not only be adopted by parliament but also taken into consideration by the council and the commission . 
the union does , however , have a weak poin. a number of weak point. namely that we need to put pressure on finland , which has not yet signed the ottawa convention , and on greece , which has not ratified it , or europe will lack credibility when it promotes the adherence of all countries to the convention and raises the questio. which we have also raised in the oral question which we are going to put to the commissio. of whether the candidate countries have to sign the ottawa convention before they become members of the union . 
other mine - clearance or victim - support actions will be of little use if we continue to produce and trade in landmines . 
we must act first in the area of prevention . 
afterwards we must invest more in research , especially research into the detection of mines placed in the ground . 
lastly , it is crucial that we reinforce mine - clearance action by ensuring the effectiveness of the actions taken and by giving priority to the countries that respect the convention , just as it is also essential that we guarantee victim rehabilitation measures . 
i would also like the commission to explain in greater detail what it intends to do in these fields , bearing in mind past experience and the important role that the european union has taken on in this area . 
the field of action is , of course , vast and requires funding and great political will . 
the challenge is enormous , but the extent of this tragedy demands that we make an enormous effort and commitment to put an end to this situation . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we all know what the consequences of anti - personnel mines are , even if there may often be important military justifications for them in individual cases . 
they result in immeasurable suffering , especially among civilians and children . 
but they also often destroy countries ' long - term development potential by contaminating entire regions . 
i also believe that there must be a proper political framework in these regions so as to give such governments the political power to escape from this vicious circle , which means that , ostensibly , in trying to provide protection for themselves they ultimately harm their own population in the long term . 
i must therefore encourage the commission to regard this not just as a technical starting point for providing some kind of financial support , but also as an important opportunity to create a political framework with a view to securing an improvement here . 
i should like to express my appreciation for the ambitious and constructive attitude of parliament which is clearly reflected in the report by mrs bonino on the draft regulation , reinforcing the european union 's contribution to the fight against anti - personnel landmines . 
it is no surprise that a report by mrs bonino is such a powerful and important document . 
i am grateful but not surprised by the tone of the report . 
after all , the european parliament took the lead in the union in the fight against landmines . 
it was parliament which first raised , in 1996, the issue of a horizontal budget line and of a proper legal base to provide a single platform for the wide range of actions that we undertake in this important field . 
parliament was instrumental in galvanising the union into taking a proactive role at the ottawa conference in 1997, which led to the conclusion of the convention to ban and eradicate landmines . 
it is the challenge of implementing that convention to the full which led the commission to reflect on how to reinforce the contribution of the european union to the battle against landmines . 
the result of that reflection is before you in the form of a proposal for a regulation . 
i should also like to mention the key role played by civil society , by highly motivated non - governmental organisations and , in particular , by the international campaign to ban landmines . 
their efforts are essential for the successful implementation of the convention and their pressure on governments around the world has contributed tremendously to the encouraging record of ratification and accession . 
over the last eight years we have contributed over eur 200 million from the community budget to the fight against landmines . 
in 1999 alone the union spent more than eur 100 million of which eur 30 million was for community projects , far more than any other international player . 
some members of the house may have seen the brochure that we prepared for the ottawa convention review conference last month , which shows the breadth of the interventions that we are making , covering every corner of the world and every aspect of mine action . 
i particularly commend the work of the joint research centre . 
being the largest contributor to this cause is not enough . 
the objective of the draft regulation is to allow us to define a strategic , overall approach and to measure our efforts against well - defined targets on the road to our common final objective of a world free of landmines . 
before i comment on the excellent report before us on the draft regulation i should like to make a few general remarks in reply to the interesting and valuable speeches made by mr miranda and mr brok . 
but we cannot penalise people when they have a lousy government . 
as for the applicant countries , we would expect them to support the joint action which i have just referred to . 
this is not community acquis in the strict legal sense of that term , but we will obviously encourage them to do away with mines in their defence , to stop manufacturing mines or trading in them , and to sign and ratify the mine ban treaty . 
if i may again follow a point mr miranda made earlier , i am particularly keen that we should also look at projects to destroy the existing stockpiles of landmines . 
it can be difficult environmentally and it is expensive but we should give that some priority in the future . 
i should like to draw parliament 's attention to the slovenia international trust fund which , in only two years of operation , has set up a regional mine - action programme with support from the european union , the united states and a number of other countries , with projects throughout the balkans . 
after the events earlier this year in zaghreb and the more recent events in belgrade , we must hope that the future of south - east europe is free of the setting of landmines . 
enhancing coherence between community and member states ' action , to which the honourable member referred , is at the very heart of the communication which accompanies the draft regulation . 
we have adopted a flexible , coordinating approach rather than a rigid , centralising one . 
mine action is most effective when it is tailored to the conditions which are specific to each situation . 
that is why we do not propose to pool all mine action , even within the community framework , in a single programme and a single budget line . 
instead , we are proposing to set up an expert group with participation from member states , from non - governmental organisations and from the other relevant players . 
the intention is that this group should assist the commission in drawing up an overall strategy for mine actions . 
so i would argue against amendment no 18 . 
while i understand and respect the ambition behind the proposal to concentrate all funds for mine action under the horizontal budget line , with the exception of echo and research lines , i am not convinced that this gives us the necessary flexibility to maximise the effectiveness of european union interventions . 
it may be that over time the horizontal line will attract more attention and more appreciation , but we also need to maintain the link to broader national or regional programming through the geographic budget lines and regulations . 
i myself would say no to proposed amendments nos 3, 16 and 21 . 
for the same reason i am confident that the human and administrative resources requested for the central mine action policy team are sufficient to guarantee the proper implementation of the regulation . 
we do not want to add new layers to our bureaucracy ; a small team and proper networking can achieve the same results . 
instead of adding another one to the list , we propose the creation of an expert group which will give us a forum going beyond government experts where we can discuss and where we can define overall mine - action strategy to be applied horizontally and to be reviewed every year . 
therefore the commission cannot accept amendments nos 8, 22, 23, 25 and 29 . 
finally , on the contracting of mine - action projects , i would caution against the introduction of stricter limitations to the participation in our tenders . 
as well as pursuing local capacity - building and ownership , we must be able to draw on the best existing expertise and material wherever it is available . 
in most cases that will be within the european union , but we may exceptionally have to turn elsewhere . 
i cannot accept amendment no 19 . 
i will not go through all the many amendments proposed by the honourable member , which the commission can readily accept and which will in my judgment significantly improve the draft regulation . 
these only confirm the sense of purpose and ambition which we all share . 
firstly , we need to be focused in our aims . 
the anti - personnel landmine campaign should not be used as an opportunity to attack western governments , particularly the united states , western military establishments , or western industry . 
for the most part , western governments are not the problem but part of the solution . 
we should concentrate our political attention on the real culprits : warring factions and irresponsible governments who have shown no concern about civil populations and who use anti - personnel landmines as indiscriminate weapons of terror . 
more importantly , practical mine action should focus on the priorities : making areas safe where the suspected presence of mines is a bar to resumption of normal life and economic development , and assistance to mine victims . 
secondly , the international community needs to improve the coordination of its efforts both at the global level and particularly within the afflicted countries . 
the fact is we still do not know the true extent of landmine infestation and we do not know how effective efforts to clear mines have been . 
a rapid stocktaking exercise needs to be conducted in each of the most afflicted countries so that we can see more clearly what needs to be done . 
thirdly , we need to ensure that money is spent well . 
i take some pride in the fact that the european commission is the world 's largest supporter of mine action . 
this is an area where , in view of the european union 's capacity for coordination of efforts by many countries , an application of large resources to the problem should be more effective . 
there are many reasons why the rhetoric has not been matched by reality . 
in a way , the landmine case characterises the wider failure of the commission to make effective use of the resources at its disposal . 
the commissioner for external relations has previously recognised that the commission 's external aid programmes have been an embarrassment . 
the commission needs to improve both the quality of its programmes and their speed of implementation . 
things are beginning to move in the right direction under mr patten 's leadership . 
the commission communication and the regulation on anti - personnel landmines are very useful documents , but they omit two key elements , which parliament 's amendments seek to correct . 
multiannual funding for mine action must be concentrated on a single budget line and there must be a properly resourced unit within the commission , specifically responsible not just for the policy framework but also for the planning and implementation of mine action , including contracts . 
top - level commitment , proper direction and management with responsibility are the keys to the effective use of resources . 
let us have no more gestures but real action and tangible results . 
at the same time , one realises that new landmines are being laid in angola , and this brings me to the point which mr patten highlighted . 
commissioner , you said that you were against a number of amendments . 
i believe , however , that if you were to study them again with more care , you would find that there are a few amendments you quoted which , in my view , concern the awareness campaigns , transparency , access for ngos , as well as things which are going well at the moment but which could run more efficiently . 
i believe that you need not be afraid of the amendments tabled by parliament in this respect . 
we do not want more bureaucracy or comitology ; instead we want to create more room for you , we want things to be done efficiently , and i believe that our priorities in this respect are not a million miles apart . 
you may want to re - read a few paragraphs to see if all these points are really ripe for the bin , which is not so easy to admit for an english person . 
i believe that , as far as that is concerned , you and parliament are on the same side . 
the socialist group feels part of this massive international anti - landmine campaign and we , together with other meps here , are proud of this . 
think of the soviet ' toy ' bombs in afghanistan . 
they are , unfortunately , incredibly cheap to produce and wildly expensive to find and destroy . 
that is a mistake this parliament is constantly making . 
the commission must have the freedom to exercise its powers , and we for our part should be free to slam the commissio. if i may use that expressio. if it does not do the work well . 
finally , i should like to thank mrs bonino . 
it is refreshing to have such an experienced rapporteur . 
thank you for a good report . 
mr president , very rarely from within the established power structures does anything new emerge . 
the ban on anti - personnel mines has led to a process that is an excellent example of how ngos and the european parliament have been able to define and pursue with determination aims the statesmen either shun or consider unrealistic . 
mr president , our group has a history of calling for the entire spectrum of measures and action needed , from suspending production to destroying stocks , stopping trading , clearing mine fields , rehabilitating victims and raising public awareness . 
however , i should like to make the following comment : the number of mines placed increases in direct proportion to the international community 's inability to find political solutions to major problems . 
when , for example , a country feels insecure along its border with another country , its government will take recourse , wrongly of course , to the easy option of a minefield . 
when the international community cannot deal with the poison of nationalism and confrontation or help find political solutions , those involved will be more willing to take recourse to minefields . 
we must bear this in mind because it seems to me , as far as the balkans are concerned , that the west and the european union must take their share of the responsibility , as the result of their political interventions , for the fact that half the balkans are a total minefield . 
i would like to end by saying that special action is needed in the balkans and i should like to use this platform to say that the greek government should ratify the ottowa convention at once . 
mr president , the cambodians call mines ' everlasting sentinels ' . 
these death traps , set off by chance by the victims themselves , sometimes many years after a conflict is over , are real time bombs that hinder the social and economic recovery of whole regions and the rehabilitation of the victims themselves . 
as a signatory to the appeal for a world without mines , i fervently support emma bonino 's report , because it is heading in the right direction . 
then it is up to the states to support the process in international fora . 
to conclude , europe must support and deepen the ottawa process to ensure that we do not have another weapon creating dozens of victims every 20 minutes , as is happening now . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i strongly support the community 's initiative against anti - personnel mines . 
i only have to picture children mutilated by mines to reach the very personal conclusion that every euro spent on opposing this madness is money well spent . 
one point that ngo representatives have criticised in conversation with me is the combination of military activity with ngo work found in points 11 and 15 of the resolution . 
in the course of many years ' work , the ngos have won people 's confidence and respect , and i fear that such a combination could compromise the independence of the ngos and permanently damage their relationship of trust with people in need . 
people have a justified mistrust of uniformed personnel , born of many years of war . 
we should therefore do everything we can to provide continuing support for the work of ngos . 
mr president , i will speak very briefly during my allotted minute , just to express regret that the council is not represented at such an important debate , although it is quite obviously the institution with the greatest scope for action in the field our members are discussing at this moment . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mrs bonino personally for all her work . 
the ottawa convention represents an important step in the international campaign to ban the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines . 
mines are of course a great obstacle to reconstruction in these countries and to the return of refugees . 
it is imperative for a ban to be imposed on producing mines in the eu and on exporting mines from the eu . 
this objective should be an absolute priority for us all . 
mr president , i am pleased that we finally have european legislation , in the form of a regulation , on anti - personnel landmines and that today we have a good report on the subject by mrs bonino . 
in the previous term of offic. as we have hear. the european parliament approved the commitment by the european union to fight against one of the cruellest , most lethal , most cowardly weapons in existence . 
the committee on development and cooperatio. as mr patten has sai. introduced a budget line in 1996 dedicated to de - mining . 
however , this heading line nonetheless unfortunately decreasing in inverse proportion to the emphasis we are placing on this matter here . 
given that we are now approving the budget , i will linger a moment over the figures that worry me . 
this year the figure was eur 8,100,000 . 
when i think of the problems and the events in developing countries , such as those in the acp area or in central america , it is evident that things cannot continue like this . 
another point i regard as vital is that we need to tackle the black market , especially in africa . 
the second important area for me is follow - up action . 
in this area we have to pay special attention to de - mining programmes and humanitarian actions . 
however , we must bear in mind that it will do so despite the fact that ' neighbouring turkey ' does not have the best of intentions vis - à - vis greece . 
this is , unfortunately , a fact of life and was brought home to us again recently , last week in fact , during nato exercises , which were seen as an opportunity for a different kind of policy in the form of a show of intransigence . 
but let us hope that the future will bring a solution to these problems . 
be that as it may , i believe that the majority vote which this report will receive here in parliament will strengthen it to the point at which even those who do not have eyes to see or ears to listen will see and will listen . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i support mrs bonino 's report , which provides for greater efficiency and transparency , and on which the committee on development and cooperation has given its opinion . 
i would like to thank her for her outstanding work . 
i witnessed the suffering of mine victims with my own eyes during and after the war in bosnia , in 1992, 1995 and 1999 . 
many victims are small children , who suffer terrible trauma and appalling mutilation , and whose lives are destroyed before they have even started properly . 
mr president , one day in december 1992, a young shepherd in mozambique forgot the risk : he thought it had gone with the coming of peace . 
anti - personnel mines ( continuation ) 
mr president , years ago when the international campaigns for landmine - clearance began , it used to be said that landmines were the poor countries ' atomic bomb . 
despite the time that has passed , this apparent exaggeration may still unfortunately serve to describe the situation . 
there can be no development without safe roads , without suitable land for cultivation and without places where children can play freely . 
that is why the european union joined and has come to play a leading role in the international campaign started by the united nations , as has already been mentioned by the previous speakers . 
we can now clearly see the merit of the proposal put before us , upon which mrs bonino has based her report . 
i support this report and any other initiative to restate the role of the european union in this objective . 
the finns are involved in international cooperation with regard to mine clearance . 
it was precisely this paragraph 7 that enabled me to abstain . 
by not voting against the resolution i am trying to support any initiative that will put an end to the antagonistic atmosphere between large and small countries in which the debate on institutional reform has taken place , and which unfortunately has to a great extent been instigated by the french presidency . 
as paragraph 7 says , it is absolutely necessary to ensure that solutions are valid and acceptable to all member states , regardless of their size or economic weight . 
in other words , among those sitting round the table of the common european home , some would eat à la carte while others would get the dish of the day . 
some would have a say about money while others , like denmark or sweden , would have to hold their tongue . 
as we saw before the existence of total , universal suffrage , there would be active " peoples " and observer " peoples " . 
there would , in a sense , be " males " with the right to talk war , taxes and money and , as in pre - 1945 france , " females " sitting round the table with no right to decide . 
moreover , in this ' variable - geometry ' europe , the number of guests with the right to eat à la carte would vary depending on the subject under discussion in the european council of ministers and this state of affairs would create further complexity in a europe whose way of operating is already quite obscure . 
in other words , the philosopher 's stone of closer cooperation , which would allow the rule of unanimity and the right of veto , which protects national interests , to be circumvented on the sly , would achieve the amazing feat of violating the principle of equality between states , excluding minority nations from key issues , thus opening up cracks in the democratic foundations of european integration , making the european institutions even less transparent and spreading confusion , if not disarray , within the council and the commission . 
once again , the technocratic smokescreen and verbal fog are conceal machinations intended to foist on the peoples a military and fiscal europe that they do not want and to deprive them of their right to say no to the loss of their national freedoms . 
the voting on this report reflects the eplp 's opposition to incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights into the treaty and the section of the report restricting unanimity in the council to constitutional issues . 
the eplp has consistently not supported incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights as rights are covered by national legislation and the european convention on human rights . 
inclusion of new text into the treaties is likely to create legal confusion . 
the restriction of unanimity in the council to constitutional issues would exclude key issues such as taxation and social security which , we believe , should remain the responsibility of member states . 
the resolution contains good sections on the federal republic of yugoslavia and the middle east and the eplp supports the resolution overall . 
summit meetings of heads of state and government always raise great expectations . 
the biarritz summit was heralded as the decisive summit which would affirm fundamental rights , all rights , even rights never conceived of previously , as if the european communities and their constituent states had hitherto lived in total chaos . 
and yet our countries do not appear to be the least attentive countries in the world to human rights . 
there is always room for improvement , of course , and democratic control must not be found wanting in this respect , but we did not feel that cataloguing these rights and including them in the treaties should be the european union 's top priority . 
and yet there are so many urgent issues to be dealt with : 1 ) the need to define an economic policy which will rescue the euro from the stagnant depths to which it has plunged and boost employment ; 2 ) the need to attract investment to the union in order to break out of the economic slump ; 3 ) the need to revise employment regulations to make the market more dynamic and more responsive ; or 4 ) the need to define a common line for a coherent diplomatic action to safeguard peace in the middle east , etc. all of these issues are extremely important and urgent in terms of the union 's future and the function which it ought to be performing in the world . 
however , as is often the case with these summits , the celebratory final declarations conceal a reality which is much more banal : the fifteen have not succeeded in establishing a common policy and the progress made with the unveiling of rights does not take away from the need to tackle the practical problems encountered by millions of families and entire categories of producers and workers . 
mr president , i voted against the duhamel report because i do not believe that we are taking the right approach . 
i agree with what mr berthu has said , that the idea of a single state with a single constitution completely undermines the national sovereignty of the member states . 
this project has been sold on the idea of a constitution for the people , which is all well and good , but if you have a single constituency you are diluting the power of the individuals in the member states . 
there has been talk about referenda and the amendments that were made to this report in relation to referenda . 
referenda are very important , but in the case of a single constituency , where you ignore almost 50 % in a member state who may vote against it , this is not democratic . 
it is interesting to see people putting forward the idea of a referendum in this way because if you consider the changes that have taken place in the treaties over the years , the single european act , the maastricht treaty and the treaty of amsterdam , very few citizens in the individual member states have had a say and , as a result , we are not sure what the citizens in the member states want . 
the recent referendum in denmark on the euro shows there are very many people who , given the opportunity , would make different statements to those made in this house , but they do not have that opportunity . 
mr president , i abstained in the vote on the request to refer back the duhamel report , by way of protest . 
i am of course a fierce opponent of the extreme right here in parliament . 
but i am deeply disturbed , mr president , that it is possible here in this chamber for a member of the lef . i have forgotten now who it wa. to call elected members of this house " polluters " of this chamber , without you calling that member to order . 
in spite of these setbacks for the idea of a federal eu state , the committee on constitutional affairs has now produced a further report designed to produce a constitution for the eu , in spite of the fact that this is not in any way something which people are demanding . 
what is needed instead is a clearer definition of the ' proximity principle ' in the european union . 
at present , this principle is merely a tool for the eu itself , for it is at present at eu level that it is decided where the political decisions are to be made , with the result that the eu is claiming policy area after policy area for itself . 
what is more , there is a need to simplify the flexibility rules so that they do more to facilitate european cooperation in accordance with the wishes of the people of europe . 
moreover , those areas which do not concern the european union and in which the member states have the sovereign right to make decisions ought to be carefully demarcated . 
to this end , it is essential that the european union should move towards a constitution that incorporates the charter of fundamental rights . 
the experience of a full democracy in the european union has everything to gain from the approval of a constitution that is clear , simple , readable and a source of reference for all citizens . 
the portuguese socialist meps do not , however , agree that ratification of this ' constitution ' should necessarily be carried out by means of a referendum . 
one must not infer from this position that we are against the use of the referendum as an institution or that the achievement of greater political depth in the european union should occur without the portuguese people being consulted . 
this choice should be made independently and freely and should not have to depend on an imposed measure that might clash with the constitutional practice of an individual country . 
that is why the portuguese socialist meps voted against the proposal of their own political group , which indicated a uniform referendum model for all the member states of the european union . 
to achieve the desirable objective of a european constitution it is inadvisable to impose rigid patterns and methods , which would inevitably lead to failure . 
in such a sensitive matter , boldness and prudence should go hand in hand . 
as a european from the very outset , an activist and president of the northern european movement and of the ' citizens of europe ' association , i am a european federalist because i believe in a political , social and citizens ' europe that is both democratic and effective . 
at a time when our european union is becoming bogged down in rampant nationalism and threatened by more or less cleverly camouflaged fascistic attitudes , we needed and we need a breath of fresh air . 
olivier duhamel and his report together achieve this very ably . 
so i have voted for his report with determination and a degree of enthusiasm . 
while appreciating what olivier duhamel has achieved , i abstained from the final vote because i think the debate on a european constitution is premature . 
while desirable in itself , a constitution of this kind could only be adopted as the crowning touch to far - reaching institutional reform . 
a constitution would be meaningful only if it formed the democratic framework for a genuine european federation , a united states of europe . 
in the name of the democratic europe we want to build , we reject the report . 
by resorting again to the means and objectives used for the charter of fundamental rights in order now to draft a constitution , the union is persisting in constructing a europe that is made neither by the people nor for them , be they citizens of the member states or the candidate countries . 
it is not built for the people , for there is not a single word on the social content of europe . 
a genuine social constitution ought to bring together , from the top down , the best acquired rights for work , women , immigrants and citizens . 
nor is it built by the people , despite a few hypocritical allusions to possible future referenda , because , once again , a few institutional delegations are to decide the fate of 385 million individuals . 
we reject this choice as the wrong one and , like the social movement , call for a different charter for a different europe . 
the vote on this report in the committee on constitutional affairs , adopted by 18 votes in favour , 2 against and 6 abstentions , reflects the gulf dividing the members of the european parliament on this subject . 
this own - initiative report by mr duhamel can be classed as one that were better not written , especially at this point in time . 
for as things stand in the various member states , it risks being rather counterproductive at a time when the top priority is not a very broad debate on a constitution but rather the drafting of a treaty that will allow the european union to digest enlargement without endangering the community method , which is the key to the success of european integration . 
in this ' constitution versus treaty ' debate , i tend to place more trust in jacques delors than in mr duhamel and those who supported him in submitting this report . 
as jacques delors rightly pointed out at a meeting of our committee on constitutional affairs scarcely a month ago , the term ' constitution ' is extremely ambiguous . 
he told us that he , like the majority of politicians , had been given to believe that we would prefer our relations with other countries to be governed by international treaty . 
but a constitution is something else entirely . 
although i do not reject the praiseworthy intention of strengthening , clarifying and deepening the european union and of simplifying the texts so as to bring its workings closer to the citizens , i did not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution . 
by its very nature a constitution may , in the form in which it is sometimes contradictorily put forward for europe , both serve as a way to ' civilise ' the union , on the basis of democracy and citizenship , and also be the instrument for a ' clarification ' of competences , a chalk circle which formally and definitively constrains the union and its bodies to very particular and specific competences . 
i would even have voted against it , but this would have been an over - radical way of judging a text as important as this . 
while it could be argued that the existing treaties are in essence the european constitution they are difficult to read and their articles are not always in a logical order . 
a future constitution could set out in a clear and ( relatively ) concise way 
the fundamental rights of european citizens 
the principle of the separation of powers and the rule of law 
the composition , role and functioning of the institutions of the union 
the allocation of powers and responsibilities 
the subsidiarity principle 
the role of european political parties 
the objective of european integration . 
there is both a positive and a negative side to this report . 
it has been note. rightly s. that over the years , there has been a useless build - up of long and complex treaties , and it would be good if these were to be re - written as one brief and readable framework treaty , which makes it clear to everyone what has been agreed so far . 
at the same time , a case has been made in favour of a european constitution , comprising this framework treaty as well as the charter of fundamental rights and laying down the role of the european political groups . 
in the event of the convention method being used in future , its task should be limited to that of acting as a focus group . 
i voted enthusiastically for the report by our fellow member , olivier duhamel , because it sounds the same note as the great voices and great expressions of resolve that have , step by step , advanced the course of european integration since the war . 
but this particular voice , and this is significant , is a parliamentary voice , the voice of an institution that attests a little more each day to the authority of the peoples within the union and its triangle of institutions . 
step by step , treaty by treaty , and we hope the treaty of nice will not belie this , the old nationalist attitudes within europe are expanding out of these narrow confines leading to the creation of a world power in a world of giants . 
however , mr gil - robles ' report is a help in this respect because it proposes that , for certain issues and sectors , some of the member states of the european union reach agreement upon joint actions . 
i therefore hope that we will opt in the near future for closer cooperation between certain state. including ital. so that we can adopt common rules for the management of pensions and workers ' pension contributions . 
we recognise that , where the pace and scope of european integration are concerned , a certain degree of differentiation within the process may be useful in so far as the common objectives are preserved and the differentiation is perceived as a tool used on an exceptional basis , in a transitional period and with due respect for the fact that it is entirely up to those countries which are not a part of the enhanced cooperation process to decide whethe. and , in certain cases , whe. they wish to accede to those areas covered by closer cooperation . 
if we cannot vote in favour of the report , it is because we cannot support the proposed changes to the political and legal conditions required for closer cooperation . 
removing the conditions which state that closer cooperation must remain within the framework of the treaty and removing the right of veto and the opportunity for bringing the issue up in the european council would constitute a breach of the quite fundamental principles according to which european cooperation in the eu operates . 
the report proposes abolishing the right of veto , which would in reality mean that countries which are very keen on further integration could forge ahead without having broad democratic support . 
the ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards ' ever closer union ' without being hampered by the enlargement to which the eu countries have committed themselves . 
enhanced cooperation would cause most policies , including the most sensitive ones , to be centralised to a still greater degree than they are already . 
in this way , mr gil - robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy . 
we consider , however , that future development will increase the need for far more varied and flexible cooperation in europe . 
to allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards . 
countries with a tradition of holding referendums before surrendering sovereignty may in future be in danger of finding themselves in a situation in which a proposal that is rejected nationally is adopted at eu level . 
those countries which are not so keen on integration are left with a poor alternative , namely that of copying the legislation without having any real say in it . 
what they cannot do , however , is avoid the pioneer countries ' legislation . 
the group for a europe of democracies and diversities wants a freer and more flexible europe in which there is no pressure to be involved in everything . 
we want to see a europe of democracies and diversity . 
we are therefore voting against the report . 
i voted against the gil - robles report on reinforced cooperation , i.e. cooperation that does not involve all but only some eu member states . 
in fact , although this report tends to introduce a little more flexibility into the highly inflexible system laid down by title vii of the treaty of amsterdam , which is welcome , the final result is still far from adequate . 
it reflects far too monolithic a concept of the union , under which all forms of cooperation would have to operate within a ' single institutional framework ' and would necessarily be directed towards the objective creating a super - state . 
the gil - robles report even proposes bringing the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy within the purview of reinforced cooperation , thus centralising those policies even more than they are at present ( paragraph 4 ) . 
these proposals are not acceptable ; the need for cooperation within europe is genuine , but also diverse and multiform , and it can no longer be locked into a uniform community framework based on majority voting . 
furthermore , the report , and this is a significant omission , contains no explanation as to how cooperation procedures involving one third of member states could actually be made to work within the existing institutions without reforming those institutions . 
in reality , the european parliament is practising delay tactics . 
parliament wished earlier to prevent the emergence of differentiated forms of cooperation in the treaty of amsterdam , but was finally forced to give way and accept ' reinforced cooperation ' . 
it is now attempting to prevent reinforced cooperation being made more flexible , but here too it will eventually lose . 
we believe that what ought to be termed ' differentiated ' cooperation procedures should not have to follow predetermined lines in their objectives ; nor should there be limits on their creation or constraints on their operation . 
some procedures could use the community framework should this be found desirable , others could create their own ad hoc institutions , linked to the union only by a liaison secretariat . 
finally , differentiated cooperation should preferably operate on the basis of the unanimity principle , thus avoiding any relapse into the disadvantages of the community method . 
we should remember that the mechanism now known as reinforced cooperation already existed well before the treaty of amsterdam . 
indeed , some member states that wanted to deepen their cooperation and go beyond the integration provided for in the treaties developed various instruments , such as the social chapter , the schengen agreements , economic and monetary union , etc. this enabled them to advance at different rates and / or with different objectives . 
with the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , the use of these instruments was formalised by the introduction of the concept of ' closer cooperation ' into the treaty on european union ( title vii ) and the treaty establishing the european community ( article 11 ) . 
in fact , europe is finding it more and more difficult to move forward at the same pace . 
so we must avoid slowing down the general pace and therefore allow some member states to move forward by developing the mechanism of reinforced cooperation . 
resorting to this instrument is tied to conditions designed to avoid turning the european union into an à la carte or multi - speed europe , a legitimate anxiety which lies at the heart of debates on this issue . 
reinforced cooperation could have an important role to play in the framework of an enlarged europe . 
however , as these provisions now stand , this mechanism cannot function correctly . 
i do not think it will be a necessarily healthy move forward for the european union if eu leaders were to accept and implement the principle of enhanced cooperation to its fullest . 
i believe that this would fly in the face of both the founding objectives and spirit of the treaty of rome and of all subsequent treaties thereafter . 
that is why the large allocation of eu structural funds was made . 
the operating structures of the internal market have been a success ever since the early 1990s . 
this principle of equality between poorer and richer nations was transcended into policies that were implemented to put in place a new european single currency regime . 
once again , if poorer and smaller countries of the european union could not reform their economic structures they would not be able to meet the economic convergence criterion as laid down in the maastricht treaty . 
eu leaders financed large - scale eu structural funds and cohesion fund programmes for smaller and poorer countries so that as many countries as possible could participate in the european single currency structure . 
not one single eu rule should stand in the way of far - reaching cooperation , subject this to conditions or require that others join in . 
that is why i am in favour of a minimum number of rules and limitations affecting reinforced cooperation between neighbours , as long as such cooperation is not intended to disadvantage third parties . 
we regret the fact that the call to moderate the ' polluter pays ' principle was endorsed , for that could open the door to misuse in the application of this specific prerogative . 
we also regret the lack of any reference to , or even mention of , the need to protect biodiversity , which is one of the most important assets of the outermost regions . 
these regions could act as a wonderful laboratory in terms of sustainable development . 
that is another missed opportunity . 
on the other hand , we welcome the paragraphs in the report on promoting renewable energies and monitoring industrial activities which cause pollution . 
dear mr fernandez . 
you sit next to me when we vote . i was very happy to vote for this report , which i am sure that you will have supported , as you always support all the measures concerning the canary islands . 
the pensioners ' party and the pensioners who support it are very familiar with these islands for they are a key tourist destination . 
it is my opinion that the european union should be more attentive and more active than it has been up till now with regard to the azores , the canary islands , guyana , martinique , madeira and reunion . 
these islands must be able to feel that they are an active part of the european union , and i hope that the union will turn them into a paradise both for tourists and for their inhabitants . 
this was the case in the gutiérrez díaz report , the fernández martín report , which promoted the inclusion of the concept in the treaty , and now in the sudre report , which restates european policy for the outermost regions . 
the european parliament is reasserting itself by adopting measures in various field. from agriculture to fisheries , from the environment to transport and energy via the information societ. with the necessary budgetary support . 
how then can we refuse to give our remote departments and territories the funding they need to make up for the costs involved in transportation , dealing with cyclones and investing in universities or hospitals ? 
when our regions , in the west indies for example , or the pacific , are tax havens used by the american multinationals , from kodak to microsoft , boeing or cargill , for massive tax - fraud exports , then the right to geographically equal competition , together with the right of all europeans to equality , requires that we devote part of the european budget , in which taxes make up 17 % of revenue , to developing the economic , social and cultural life of our compatriots who live in regions that may well be outermost in terms of geography but are central in terms of civilisation . 
the fact that the outermost regions exist is tied up to a large degree with colonial history . 
in the middle ages , those regions and their people did not belong to europe , and even today , they are not really considered to be european . 
even before the nineteenth century , spain , portugal , france , england and the netherlands had already conquered substantial colonial empires and belgium , germany , denmark and italy tried to follow in their footsteps for a short while . 
this colonial era has now passed . 
mr president , i apologise to the presidency and to the interpreters , who have to listen to this last explanation of vote and , in particular , i sympathise with the translators of our explanations of votes , particularly , in my case , the italian translator , ornella buson . 
i will endeavour to take as little advantage as possible of this right to explanation , but i would like to say that i too voted for the report on the establishment of the food safety agency . 
the reason why the report is important is clear , especially when i remember that one of my neighbours was taken into hospital one day with acute stomach pains , after eating poisonous mushrooms which he had not had checked out by the relevant person . 
mr john bowis ' report will ensure that the food we eat is always healthy , natural and safe . 
you said that this would be the last time you would speak , mr fatuzzo , but you must just have meant for today ! 
i was a little worried ! 
mr president , i voted for mr bowis ' report and of course i want to emphasise the high quality of the work done by our rapporteur . 
let me say how glad i am that our parliament is finally delivering its opinion on such an important subject , while regretting that it has been 10 months since the european commission presented its white paper on 12 january this year . 
it was essential for us to give an opinion on an issue that is so important to our fellow citizens . 
our vote has thus clarified the composition of the future european agency , while also setting out our specific requirements regarding its funding and its independence . 
this first step must not close our eyes to the serious work that still needs to be done on risk management , developing and improving the rapid alert system , but also on ensuring traceability and public information . 
far from representing a final stage , the report must therefore signal the start of a huge undertaking , namely the essential and rapid reworking of our legislation on food . 
at first glance , the commission 's white paper on food safety appears to be full of good intentions , since it mainly proposes the creation of a european food safety agency responsible for managing a rapid alert network and totally independent when it advises the management authorities . 
but on reading the report or perusing the european parliament 's resolution on the same subject , the picture becomes far less pleasing . 
in fact it becomes clear that the purpose of the agency is to take over national defence powers , or to paralyse them , and to put them at the service of the commission 's objectives . 
now that is absolutely intolerable . 
the french must remember that despite the commission 's splendid declarations about its resolve " to assure the highest standards of food safety " in the union , it is actually the commission , and none other , that is giving precedence to the demands of the free movement of products over public health requirements ; it is the commission , and none other , that has , for example , just dragged france before the court of justice for maintaining its ban on british beef . 
it is unacceptable that we should abandon any part of our national right of decision and right of protection , in relation to food safety questions . 
however , the creation of that agency is imperceptibly guiding us in that very direction . 
first of all , we must remember that the power to provide advice plays a capital part . 
in the mad cow affair , the reason the french government continued the ban was because it was backed up by the independent opinion of the french food safety agency ( afssa ) , even though the supposedly scientific european committee saw nothing wrong with allowing british meat to be imported into france . 
consequently , if a european agency is necessary , it must be complementary to the national agencies and in no way reduce their legitimacy . 
that is not at all the direction taken by the white paper , which wants to make the european agency into a " scientific point of reference for the whole union " ( page 5 ) . 
secondly , the european agency must be completely independent . 
the director of the agency should certainly not be appointed by the commission , contrary to what the european parliament is proposing ( paragraph 21 of the resolution ) . 
nor should the commission appoint the scientific experts , even following what appears to be a rigorous selection procedure . 
moreover , the agency must be able to criticise the commission itself . 
that is not at all the view of the white paper , which calls for the agency to develop very close working links with the commission services because , as it explains with a certain aplomb , " it will allow the authority ( agency ) to be responsive to the needs of the commission services " ( page 20 ) . 
thirdly , the agency must not encroach upon the management of risks and regulatory power . 
the commission 's white paper has the grace to admit that , but on closer perusal we find that the regulatory power it is so keen to protect is that of... the commission , and not the states . 
that does not prevent the commission and parliament from christening the agency a " european authority " , a title totally contrary to the philosophy that supposedly inspires it . 
the european parliament even adds , in paragraph 6 of its resolution , the phrase " while subjecting the powers to be transferred to detailed scrutiny " , just when we thought that no powers were to be transferred . 
we therefore believe that the white paper and parliament 's report are traps , which is why we are opposed to them . 
the member states must retain full responsibility for food safety , because they are close to their people and will react more rapidly than the commission , which , moreover is constantly blinded by its free - trade prejudices . 
there is without doubt a need for an agency that takes a european view of the situation , but it must be strictly consultative and totally independent . 
the best idea would be for it to emanate solely from the national agencies and to network with them . 
therefore all the measures proposed to change the situation and protect consumers deserve our support , particularly the setting - up of a european food safety agency to analyse the risks scientifically , working in close collaboration with existing national agencies in this field and the main european consumers ' organisations . 
so today we need to correct the adverse effects on public health of a policy very largely inspired by the commission , as mrs thomas - mauro quite rightly pointed out this morning . 
let me make myself abundantly clear : i am against any form of budgetary aid given to warring countries , for this aid is invariably used to buy weapons , directly or indirectly . 
this is another weak area in our european policy . 
mr president , the new cooperation agreement signed in cotonou represents an ideal opportunity to correct the deficiencies noted in previous measures and to clarify concepts and standards for action in specific situations in which we cooperate with the acp countries , for example , in the situation that gave rise to the commission communication which concerns us here and to the reports by mr van hecke and mrs maes , that is , what should happen when an associate country is involved in armed conflict . 
along the lines of what was said by the rapporteurs , we think the european union will have to revise its programmes of aid to countries at war , amongst other reasons to prevent the funds allocated from being diverted to military activities . 
many countries are repaying their debts several times over . 
some countries still spend more on debt repayment than on health and education combined , and yet the people suffering from this diversion of resources are certainly not those who had any benefit from the original loans that were given . 
mr president , i also welcome both the commission communication and the report we have here today . 
one key message in all this is the need for consistency . 
the european union has a number of activities under its umbrella : trade , lomé agreements , cfsp , external policies and far too often one part is not necessarily consistent with another . 
consistency must be our primary objective . 
secondly , conflict prevention must be a priority of the european union . 
we are now getting the measures in place . 
we have the high representative , we have the planning and early warning unit in the council . 
they must now emphasise that it is conflict prevention we need to focus on rather than intervening militarily after a conflict has got out of control . 
in particular , we must give due emphasis to things such as scarcity of water resources as a cause of conflict . 
commission policy should be aimed at ensuring that we enhance water supplies , not diminish them as has sometimes been the case . 
as has been mentioned before , we need to stress the importance of good governance and democracy . 
that should be a part of conditionality and we should demand of member states that they do not support politicians for short - term requirements if they do not meet the essential requirements of good governance and democracy . 
far too often , we are prepared to support one against another group to the long - term detriment of peace in a particular region . 
finally , what we must do of course , is to stem the flow of arms into these regions , not just by actions against small arms . 
i would like to see , as i outlined in my report last month , action taken against arms brokers throughout the european union . 
in many countries , there are no controls over the activities of arms brokers . 
they are able to trade as they will , and in almost every conflict you will find arms brokers behind the proliferation of arms . 
it is crucial as part of the eu code of conduct that we license arms brokers and start to control their activities . 
it is no good governments tidying up exports if we allow private individuals to act in they way they are doing . 
similarly , we should also look at licensed manufacturing . 
in particular , the death penalty is applied relatively often to the disadvantaged and to minorities . 
the underlying principle of the death penalty is revenge , which is inappropriate in a civilised state . 
whether it is abu - jamal in the usa , öçalan in turkey or even the execution of abdul achmin sabiin ira. we should condemn all of this . 
i regard the death sentence as a barbaric .. . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , in the same way as the treaty of amsterdam and the european charter of fundamental rights , parliament has repeatedly declared itself to be opposed to the death penalty which sadly , as has been pointed out , still exists in many countries of the world : countries with antidemocratic traditions such as communist china and extremely liberal countries such as the united states . 
we are also aware of how difficult it is to succeed in eliminating this penalty which is so very unnatural and inhumane . 
it is even difficult in america where , as mrs frassoni pointed out , those who represent the institutions , the policy - makers , do not dare to propose abolishing capital punishment for fear of losing support . 
the reason is clear : with the rise in organised crime the death penalty is considered to be a deterrent , containing and checking the increase in crime and illegal activity . 
however , we know that this is not at all the case ; we know that the death penalty is an abhorrent practice , a form of state - legalised crime . 
having said that , commissioner , i feel that , precisely on this type of subject , working in conjunction with organisations which operate in society or with non - governmental organisations is a key factor , for these organisations usually have greater room for manoeuvre , and are able to be bolder and uphold positions which are , so to speak , less influenced by other considerations or interests , in themselves legitimate but all too often liable to lead governments and institutions to compromise and assume less forthright positions . 
this is precisely why part of the resolution calls upon the commission to be more explicit in its report and in providing transparent information on the use of the year 2000 budget lines relating to this matter and to democratisation in general . 
the second poin. which you raised , commissioner , and which , i am happy to say , was taken up by many of the member. is that the commission must exercise great care in allocating its financial resources in order to support campaigns which are able to alter the public perception of the death penalty . 
as mr salafranca pointed out , there was a rather embarrassing moment in the debate for the us presidential elections when both the candidates for the presidency of the united states declared that they were in favour of the death penalty . 
there have been legal doubts concerning a number of the cases , and there have also been a number of cases concerning children . 
in at least one of these cases , the child concerned was mentally handicapped . 
with the presidential election in mind , it is incredibly important that we should express our disgust in this chamber . 
i wish vigorously to support the proposal of my fellow mep , mr rutelli , for a european day of opposition to the death penalty during our presidency . 
mr president , between noble intent and practical action falls a shadow ; on the issue of the death penalty it is the shadow of geopolitics and economic interests . 
your stand today on capital punishment goes beyond noble intent . 
you mentioned the year 2000 budget lines aimed at financing campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty . 
so i urge the commission to focus and extend the use of the assistance funds to the two main nations where state murder is practised with no restraint and with great relish : the people 's republic of china and the united states of america . 
yes , we know the issue has been raised ritually and periodically with the governments of both countries , but we have to do much more . 
for instance , as regards the united states , some of this money should be invested in sensibilisation campaigns in europe , certainly not in order to boycott a sovereign state like texas , but to re - route european tourism and european industrial investment to those 12 states that do not indulge in such a barbaric practice . 
mr president , i am personally opposed to the death penalty for a variety of reasons , and despite this , i would like to make two fundamental observations which are at odds with everything that has been said so far in this chamber . 
first of all , surely we should not be comparing apples and oranges . 
there is a world of difference between the implementation of the death penalty in , for example , the united states on the one hand , and in countries such as china , pakistan , saudi arabia , north kore. to name but a few of a long lis. on the other . 
in the first case , we are talking about the highest penalty for extremely dangerous criminals who , moreover , have been able to avail themselves of very many defence mechanisms in the democratic court procedures . 
in the other cases , the death penalty is often a kind of random and horrifying tool of intimidation used by no means only against dangerous criminals under common law . 
anyone who lumps all of this together is clearly deluding himself . 
secondly , i have to say that it is easy to shed crocodile tears over the fate of dangerous criminals in democratic states . 
it is somewhat more difficult to take pity on those left behind , for example old people who are tortured to death for their savings , badly paid money couriers who are shot dead by gangsters in a heartless act , or children who are raped and killed . 
if i were convinced that in europe , there is the will to look after the fate of victims and the safety of victims , i , along with you , would condemn the death penalty here today without any reservation . 
i can only establish that in practice , certainly in my country , extremely dangerous criminals are systematically set free early and it is not unusual for them to commit horrific crimes again . 
it is in those circumstances not surprising that many people say that the death penalty for some monsters who have offended again and again could have saved numerous innocent lives . 
mr president , commissioner , this debate , which is a repeat of other , previous debates would , on the surface , appear superfluous and outdated . 
a debate on the death penalty is a debate which harks back to the development of a civilised legal system , which is something europe already has . 
and yet it is topical and important in terms of world affairs . 
it is important for the parliament of europ. of western europ. to treat it as such since two traditions have evolved in europe over the millennium : one which derives from the roman tradition which influenced the european legal culture , particularly that of italy and germany , and recently paved the way for the new rights to freedoms , and then the tradition of common law , which is a basic part of the british bill of rights . 
despite certain very tragic events which have taken place in europe , despite the fact that there have been fascist and communist cultures that have trampled underfoot rights to freedoms and the rights of individuals , i feel it noteworthy that agreement has been reached time and time again in this parliament in discussing the death penalty and firmly condemning it in any form whatsoever . 
in my opinion , the charter of fundamental rights which is under discussion , for which nice will be a decisive moment , is based on this value , the value of the human person , the value of the right to freedom . 
we italians are of the tradition of cesare beccaria , as has already been said , but beccaria was a man who belonged to europe , who rejected mediaeval , obscurantist law in its entirety in favour of modern law , in favour of a legal system which does not make us wolves to our fellow men but , by means of peaceful civil coexistence , guarantees freedoms . 
capital punishment is always incompatible with peace in civil coexistence and we must find the courage to declare that accepting a moratoriu. although that would be great step forwar. is not enough to make a country genuinely democratic : to achieve true democracy it must abolish the death penalty . 
we will win ' . 
indeed , encouraging signs bear witness to the rising abolitionist trend at a global level . 
like the european parliament , the united nations is now participating in the inevitable debate that is taking place across all levels of society . 
in the united states , opinion is still very much in favour of capital punishment , but its hold has been shaken . 
a study by the university of columbia brought to light an almost 60 % rate of errors committed in twenty years in the executions that were carried out . 
innocent people are being killed and racism is evident in the application of the death penalty . 
rumour has it that this situation will soon change . 
mr president , commissioner , i am grateful for your comments , and support everything you have said . 
i would have said it in a similar way , except that i express myself differently . 
i had the same experience when i was in serbia a fortnight ago with mr swoboda . 
although we were not there before mr hombach , we did go there , because we have the funds to help people there . 
mr hombach only went there to make his presence felt and to establish what it might be possible to do . 
we know what can be done and we are in a position to make the funding available tomorrow , which i am very pleased about . 
i am also sure that under your auspices , commissioner , emergency aid really will be provided swiftly . 
this time last year i visited belgrade , a rather bleak city , veering from despair to hope on a daily basis . 
i went to see the ngos working in humanitarian and free media fields , financed by the european union , and the picture was not a particularly happy one . 
the aspiration was there but the actuality was not . 
the promise was there but the performance was not , because the money was not coming through and there was an administrative bungle . 
you spoke about the danube , but it is simply not enough to carry out studies . 
urgent action must be taken because the danube is being polluted by stockpiles of sulphuric acid and from sources in mitrovica . 
the organisations in the media field have done magnificently . 
we were superbly well - served by the swedish - helsinki committee , for example , but there has been excellent cooperation and despite all the difficulties put in our way by milosevic 's regime , we were able to get a considerable amount of help through to the democrats and the democratic forces in serbia . 
that i hope played a small part in bringing about change . 
the honourable lady was entirely right to say that it is sometimes suspected that encouraging regional cooperation is a sort of brussels stalling on the route towards europe . 
we have to explain to people that what we are trying to see happen in south - east europe is what we know has worked for us . 
the european union is the best example in the world of countries dealing with ancient animosities , countries becoming both more politically stable and more prosperous by knocking down frontiers , by knocking down boundaries and in certain areas pooling their sovereignty and doing things together that they do better together . 
that is what we are trying to encourage the countries of south - east europe to do . 
for example , we are saying to them , we will give you very generous trade access to our markets but you have to give generous trade access to your neighbours ' markets as well . 
2000 / 2103 ( cos ) ] ; 
the report ( a5 - 0271 / 2000 ) by mr moreira da silva , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the european commission green paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the european union [ com ( 2000 ) 8 . 
let us begin by examining the green paper on ' emissions trading ' . 
let me highlight six points from my considerations . 
one : the green paper should have set quantified targets for greenhouse gas reduction to be attained by the emissions trading system ; in other words , the green paper should have said what percentage of greenhouse gas reduction would be allocated to emissions trading . 
two : i believe the green paper should not have avoided carrying out an analysis into the possibility that the emissions trading system might give nuclear energy a competitive advantage . 
three : i believe it is essential that the system should in future embrace certain sectors that the green paper has ruled out for now , especially transport , which is the sector in which emissions are growing the fastest . 
four : in the debate on the scope of the system , the commission should not have set direct emissions trading between companies as the only possible option . 
there are other options , and i hope the commission will soon consider all the alternatives . 
it is a disappointment because it results in the role of policies and measures , in other words , the role of domestic and community political action , being sidelined in favour of market mechanisms . 
it is also a disappointment because this communication results in an unbalanced treatment of the various economic sectors ; in particular it was hoped that those sectors that were not included in the emissions trading system might see the approval of an ambitious approach with well - defined commitments in the other communication , the one on policies and measures . 
i therefore call on the commission to conclude the european climate change programme , the iccp , with some urgency and to submit , six months after cop - 6, a set of specific proposals on policies and measures defining quantitative commitments on the reduction of greenhouse gases for each economic sector and for each policy and measure . 
let me very briefly say a few words about the forthcoming united nations conference , cop - 6, which will take place in the hague this november . 
the difficulty with cop - 6 is not just a result of the complexity of the kyoto leftovers but also of the political situation in the united states . 
note that , regardless of the result of the american elections , it will be bill clinton and al gore who will be negotiating the kyoto protocol in the hague . 
so we face some extremely worrying scenarios . 
if bush wins , all the agreements we make in the hague with the clinton administration may be totally ignored by the new administration . 
if al gore wins , there is nothing to prevent it continuing to be very difficult to find the two - thirds majority in the senate needed to ratify the protocol . 
i therefore think that the european union should not give up its negotiating agenda . 
the european union has a good negotiating agenda and should not give it up . 
in addition , the system must be competitively neutral on behalf of the companies involved . 
in this respect , we have serious objections to a few paragraphs in the present motion for a resolution , for these aim to distort competition through an inconsistent adoption of the sector - by - sector approach . 
ultimately , we want a cleaner environment . 
this can be achieved by the introduction of tradable emission rights without directly interfering in the economic structures . 
mr president , commissioner , firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur for having reliably compiled all our views producing an excellent piece of work . 
the subject of emissions trading entered the debate on climate as part of the so - called flexible mechanisms . 
the european union did not actually want these to be included in the selection , but they are now part of an international agreement , and regulations are being drafted in the hague for these flexible mechanisms , of which the trade - off in emissions is an important one . 
as the eu has been a leading force in these international discussions until now , we must all certainly hope that this position of leadership will be kept up , and we place our trust in the commission in this . 
it is also very important that the trade in emissions is monitored effectively , and i believe that we will also need environmental inspectors , which is the subject of talks we are now conducting with the council . 
the next thing required is for the commission to bring forward a directive sharing the burden among the 15 member states . 
so we need quotas . 
but these quotas must be linked with sanctions , otherwise they will be meaningless . 
in other words we will then have a common energy policy via environment policy , which would be a very circuitous route . 
we could then start emissions trading within the european union in 2005 . 
once more , i hope that we will be able to adhere to this scenario , more or less , and that we will not let ourselves be put off by the fact that others , perhaps even the united states , will not have signed it for the time being . 
we should support the commission here and present a united front as far as possible . 
commissioner , allow me to focus for a moment , in the context of mr da silva 's excellent report and the situation which she has just described , which is important and full of potential for the future , on a phenomenon which is assuming dramatic proportions : the floods which affected huge areas of europe last week , primarily northern italy but also france and spain . 
we are acquiring the habit of describing our times in dramatic language : verbs such as to overflow , to flood , to burst banks , are part of a vocabulary which is becoming almost the norm . 
we feel that this is a dramatic consequence of the climate change taking place and that the social and economic system must provide some sort of response to this . 
even the climate experts tell us that the very meteorology of our regions is changing . 
the exceptional amount of rain which has fallen over the last few days has served to offset the prevailing drought of the past year . 
we are told that the drought trend will continue into the years to come and worsen as time goes by , unavoidably interspersed with the odd deluge and resulting floods . 
and so , now that , sadly , our dead have been buried , the journalists have left the devastated areas and the river , in this case the p. i live by the p. is again taking its normal course , it is time , as we say in italy , to put up our umbrellas , not to appear prophets of doom but to evaluate once again the requirements and the remedies . 
certainly , a great deal of progress had been made in recent years in the area of alert and alarm measures , which have made it possible to keep the scale of the disasters in check , but although this is important , it cannot be considered a primary factor . 
we need a defence policy dedicated purely to following up the recommendations of the experts . 
therefore , we must reaffirm the role of agriculture as the protector of the environment , a role which is wont to be sidelined , overlooked and undervalued on sunny days . 
the increase in air traffic in the next fifteen years alone will cancel out the reductions achieved via the kyoto protocol . 
china is already emitting more greenhouse gases than is sustainable . 
we cannot turn a blind eye to this . 
after 2020, developing countries too are supposed to fight greenhouse gases , but on an equal footing . 
after ratification , co2 emission will have a price tag . 
at present , it is still free to the large industries and the electricity producers in europe , which are , together , responsible for 45 % of co2 emissions . 
last year , the tragedy in france destroyed hundred - year - old forests : an immeasurable loss for mankind . 
mr president , five years ago , italy suffered another great flood . 
houses , bridges , roads , factories , shops and entire villages were destroyed on that occasion too . 
at the time , in my capacity as an mep and member of the alleanza nazionale party , i asked the commission to immediately prepare a measure identifying the areas at risk from flooding and to draw up a hydrogeological map of the regions of the european union . 
five years have passed , we are discussing another flood and there is still no hydrogeological map . 
europe has done absolutely nothing to intervene and it has not put any pressure on the national states to change and improve the situations in the individual countries either . 
we are now proposing this map again , in the hope that we will not still be here , five years from now , counting bodies and reproaching ourselves for not having done our duty : a map of the areas of the european union at risk , a directive laying down safety standards for buildings constructed beside rivers and streams , establishing operating criteria for forest management and preventing the working of mines and quarries in sites which are at risk , with penalties for those who authorise them and those who exploit them . 
we have to realise that preventing hazards which contribute to ecological change is the best way to protect the environment . 
this development , rural development included , must be environmentally friendly , for what is environmentally friendly is human - friendly as well . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the changing climate in europe has been causing natural disasters for a number of decades now , and these disasters have not yet been sufficiently analysed and evaluated . 
padania , which is the most advanced geopolitical and cultural area in europe , has suffered tragic flooding that has taken a huge toll on human life and property . 
the italian government , which has set aside ridiculously small sums given the scale of the disaste. of which , moreover , warning was give. in a key production area for italy and europe , is treating these hard - working people inappropriately , irresponsibly and inefficiently , as it did the people affected by the earthquakes in umbria and southern italy . 
however , i believe that we must use every possible means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions . 
it also makes me angry that when member states discuss national eco - taxes , although these national instruments are quite rightly criticised , few positive suggestions are made to replace them . 
and that is the reason why on behalf of the group of the european people 's party i have tabled an amendment calling for a european climate tax which covers all greenhouse gases and is revenue - neutral . 
we have a chance to correct the mistakes made at national level and to give a positive signal on behalf of europe . 
the group of the european people 's party also considers that nuclear energy will be indispensable at least for the next few decades if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
that is why i believe that in future negotiations we should really concentrate on the idea that if the usa cannot initiate the ratification process , then we ourselves should enter into agreements with other countries , as ultimately ratification without the usa is not impossible if we are at long last to make some progress here . 
we cannot keep making concessions until there are no more to be made if we are not certain that congress will eventually give its approval . 
commissioner , i of course heard your speech about the european climate change programme , the eccp . 
it was a rather bland speech about what we could all do and how marvellous that would be . 
so how about finally forgetting those bland speeches , rolling up our sleeves and really getting something done ! 
mr president , i am glad to hear that the commissioner is pressing for eight members of this house to attend cop6, but i want to emphasise that we want to play a constructive role in eu strategy making . 
we do not want to be squeezed out as members were who attended the world health organisation conference recently . 
we see ourselves working together at a set of european institutions fighting to improve the situation and ensure that the kyoto protocol is ratified . 
there was no recognition of the need to make sacrifices or to accept that we have historic responsibilities on both sides of the atlantic as the largest emitters of greenhouse gases . 
for all our good intentions , however , it looks as though in the european union far from cutting co2 emissions by the end of this decade we shall end up increasing them . 
so the prospects for cop6 look poor , but the prospects of our meeting our goals even with kyoto do not look that good either . 
that is not helped by governments across the european union responding to calls to cut fuel prices . 
if we are serious about the environment , these must be resisted . 
we should not be cutting fuel tax . 
i say " yes " to emissions tradin. let us get on with it . 
let us also hurry up with the measures we need to take in each member state cutting traffic emissions , increasing energy efficiency , promoting renewables and chp . 
the sad truth is we will not succeed in preventing climate change anyway , but if we do not start taking action now , the problems will become all the worse . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , some people are attempting to get the nuclear debate put back on the agenda . 
i believe that european environment ministers have so far adopted the very wise approach of excluding it from the list of flexible mechanisms . 
mr president , the rapporteur correctly maintains that climate change is one of the most serious environmental problems we are facing today . 
although three years have already passed since the kyoto conference and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by 8 % in comparison with 1990 levels , and as the european environment agency has reminded us , if very specific political measures are not taken , this reduction will not take place ; on the contrary , greenhouse gases will increase by 6 % . 
it should be considered that emissions from transport could increase the most rapidly , potentially rising by up to 39 % by the year 2010 . 
i also share the rapporteur 's concern for specific policies and measures to take priority over emissions trading , which should be ancillary to them . 
i do not entirely share mr liese 's faith and enthusiasm regarding nuclear energy . 
i consider , like the member who spoke earlier , that nuclear energy poses unresolved problems , and the fact that the commissioner said nuclear energy will not be promoted in the proposals currently being studied reassured me . 
in any case , we believe that the priority for the european union must be specific measures and policies and the definition of a european programme on climate change , which must also have specific objectives and aims , and it worries us that this is not the philosophy that will be advocated at the forthcoming hague conference . 
in conclusion , mr president , i , like other members , will recall the floods in spain and italy , which seem to us , like other so - called natural disasters , to be an expression of climate change . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i would like to add my congratulations to those already offered to the rapporteur for these two superb reports . 
this is also an opportunity to encourage research and development in the field of new technologies for controlling pollution , contrary to the opinion of those who believe that this mechanism is a way of perpetuating the interests of the large polluting corporations . 
if this tool is correctly applied , pollution will become more and more expensive and the market will ensure that products obtained through the least clean methods become obsolete . 
likewise , making emissions the subject of trade will lead to greater control over them and , what is more , they will be documented . 
this will promote the development of activities with a less significant environmental impact . 
it is essential that this mechanism is developed transparently as an integral part of the raft of measures that the member states is to adopt within the context of the european climate change strategy . 
to this end , all the member states must take great pains to communicate with the public so that it is clear from the outset which objectives are being pursued with this mechanism and what the benefits are , that these are always partial and complementary to other types of measure . 
in this way there can be no misunderstandings . 
mr president , commissioner , a large proportion of the world population , especially in the third world , will soon need boots to protect their feet from rising water levels . 
but recently , in italy too , the dramatic effects made themselves felt . 
the exact relationship between co2 emissions and global warming is not yet entirely clear , but that should not prevent us from taking drastic measures now . 
the precautionary principle is applicable here . 
according to experts , we need to reduce current co2 emission levels by 60 % in order to halt climate change . 
we are now working towards an 8 % reduction , which is already quite a task . 
although we are rightly investing in more sustainable energy and greater efficiency , our intentions are not new . 
yet , we need to establish that our dependence on fossil fuels has hardly fallen since the 70s . 
we therefore need to employ all possible means and use them to the full . 
that translates into an unqualified ' yes ' to the trade in emission rights , provided it is thought through properly . 
we still need to find solutions to major economic and political problems . 
emissions trading could lead to a new form of colonialism . 
it is easier for rich countries to buy reductions in developing countries and thus acquit themselves of their responsibilities without giving the matter another thought . 
technological innovation will be curtailed as a result . 
the success of emissions trading will therefore depend on the price . 
if the price is too low , the purchase of emission rights will be very attractive indeed . 
its success will also depend on support . 
the trade in emissions must be fair and must be able to rely on a level playing field in the sectors involved . 
the market must be deployed in a bid to promote sustained growth as well as fair distribution . 
this requires clear political choices . 
the climate conference at the hague presents an opportunity to take global steps , an opportunity which we should not let slip . 
we must not hide behind the unwillingness of the united states . 
it would be just as unacceptable to admit carbon sinks among the flexibility measures . 
it would be particularly improper and fallacious to make citizens believe that it is enough simply to plant trees to comply with the commitments undertaken at kyoto . 
with 80 % of its electricity coming from nuclear power and with an extensive covering of forest , france , for example , has not achieved the undertakings it agreed to at kyoto , which are nonetheless minimal at 0 % . 
with regard to this matter , it is vital for the union not to restrict itself to making exceptional interventions once disasters have already occurred , as has already been said . 
i would emphasise , in particular , points 6, 7 and 8 of the joint resolution : europe must call upon the member states to update their laws on the environment , the abuse of planning permission , reforestation , the revitalisation of mountain areas and , in general , on the promotion of farming methods which are intended to protect and safeguard the land as well as yield increasing quantities of produce . 
clearly , an action of this scale cannot be effectively developed purely at national level , primarily because of the scale of the resources needed but also because of the very nature of the natural phenomena in question which , like those relating to climate change and damage arising from co2 emissions , are in no way contained by borders . 
in asking you to support our resolution , ladies and gentlemen , we are calling not merely for an urgent intervention to contribute to repairing the damage but for a longer - term policy which will make europe an increasingly safer and more enjoyable place to live for its citizens . 
mr president , the commission and others have predicted that most member states will not achieve their targets for limiting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the commitments under the kyoto protocol , so it is essential that effective measures are implemented now . 
failure to reach the targets is simply not an option . 
one estimate says that 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years because of the effects of climate change , the majority of them in the developing countries . 
we need a radical change of direction . 
we can , and must , adopt effective and innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time protect our society and our jobs . 
wales , which is the constituency i represent , is very dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry . 
because the uk is introducing a climate change levy next april , i commissioned research on the effects of this on industry in my own constituency . 
the evidence suggests that not only could it keep britain on track to meet its emissions target , but the levy could actually encourage a small increase in employment . 
several economists have analysed the effects of this on a europe - wide level , and have come to similar conclusions that there is , or could be , a beneficial effect on employment . 
the debate has moved on and we need to look at reducing emissions , not as a threat , but as a challenge and an opportunity . 
i hope parliament 's demands which are set out in the reports before us are acted upon and that governments approach the hague conference in a positive way so we can see the kyoto protocol ratified in the near future . 
no woodland owner gets a penny piece directly from this important social function and monetary payments for environmental permits and their trading must , it seems to me , have to work their way through to those who actually grow and manage the trees and not be expropriated by exchequers and others on the way . 
obviously , unless forestry pays , nobody is going to plant the trees and if the trees are not planted they cannot clean up the co2 . 
in addition , it is quite wrong for the relatively poor industry to clean up the mess left by the relatively rich industry , free , gratis and for nothing . 
this in turn offers a potential further income stream for beleaguered farmers and others in the countryside to help rebuild its economic base , which at present , as we all know , is producing too much food at too high a price . 
agriculture is a multi - output industry and public expenditure may well be necessary to achieve the full range of public goods the industry can and should produce . 
i can see that the commission is doing its best . 
if country - based quotas were allocated to different sectors in the eu , as , for example , mr blokland suggested when he presented the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , companies engaged in the same sort of business would end up in totally unequal positions across the different member states . 
this would inevitably lead to distortion of the competition situation and , for that reason , we must not impose binding , quantitative targets on different sectors of industry at community level . 
it is essential to promote measures that can be implemented in practice and do not jeopardise the competitiveness of enterprises . 
along with france , my own country , finland , is at present the only eu country where the building of additional nuclear power stations is being considered . 
i wholeheartedly support the building of additional nuclear power plants , as it would give our energy - intensive industry a greater competitive advantage both in terms of economy and emissions . 
for that reason we should not adopt a position in this report either in favour of individual forms of electricity production or specifically in opposition to them : instead , all the various forms of energy production must be at our disposal while we formulate national climate strategies . 
i would also like to emphasise the importance of voluntary , negotiated target agreements . 
in many member states they have been considered a very effective means of promoting the implementation of climate - related targets . 
voluntary agreements could in particular be a good mechanism for use in the enlargement process . 
the second amendment i put down was for the granting of credits to national quotas for the planting of forests , which , as my colleague lord inglewood pointed out before , act as carbon sinks . 
they are desirable in terms of supporting the beauty of the countryside and they are also eminently policeable by satellite technology . 
emissions trading merely supplements those measures , both at member state and european level , which we shall be sure to incorporate into our basic political systems and infrastructures in order to manage climate change . 
on 27 september the commission therefore adopted a proposal based on a council decision which instituted a community mechanism to coordinate measures for civil protection during emergencies . 
the key actions included in this decision are : identification of and improved coordination among the key actors to intervene in the case of emergencies ; special training programmes to promote better cooperation and complementarity between the actors concerned ; establishment of efficient communication systems to allow for better and more rapid communications . 
the proposal also permits faster and more effective steps to be taken on behalf of victims . 
in the area of research i would like to point out that there are currently several projects under way related to flooding as well as the concerted action to reduce the risks associated with climate . 
finally , although the structural funds are not designed to address the consequences of natural disasters , they can be used for reconstruction projects if the beneficiary member states allocate the funds for such uses and the region hit by the disaster is eligible . 
the possibility of structural fund involvement in cases of natural disaster must fit within the requirements of the funds and the following conditions must be met : the area in question must be eligible for funding under the territorial objectives , namely objective 1 or objective 2 . 
co - finance projects must involve expenses that are normally eligible for structural funds . 
eligible reconstruction projects may not represent the majority of expenditure in the programme concerned . 
the actions must have a transitional nature , one or two years maximum , and they may not continue throughout the programming period . 
and the structural funds may not be substituted for insurance . 
in order to call upon the structural funds for this type of action it must be shown that the programme has room to manoeuvre internally . 
it goes without saying that the member states concerned are in charge and that it is up to them to envisage what type of measure they would like to see eventually financed by the structural funds when the conditions for intervention are fulfilled . 
with regard to cooperation on spatial planning solutions to flooding problems , the commission knows that the interreg iii guidelines make specific reference to the possibility of formulating joint strategies for risk management in areas prone to natural disasters and drawing up and implementing integrated strategies and actions for the prevention of flooding in transnational river catchment areas . 
the commission would also expect that flood prevention actions would form part of a transnational strategy which covers areas where flooding is a particular risk under interreg iii . 
for its part , the commission will continue to give prompt and constructive consideration to this type of request . 
last september , on the occasion of a resolution regarding forest fires which was passed by your assembly , mr nielson announced that the commission was considering whether or not to propose a legal basis for a budgetary line which would permit the commission to respond to emergency needs in the union . 
i think that what are needed are some more aggressive and effective initiatives in the short term . 
i also think that a major effort should be made to establish effective monitoring in the member states and under the auspices of the eu . 
industry must be required to report on which chemical substances are being put onto the market , in what quantities they are being used and what the expected effects are . 
we all also know that more resources must be put into research into both the extent of the problem and the consequences of it , as well as research into test methods and special research on mixture effects and synergetic effects . 
we know that these substances can interact in a particularly unfortunate way . 
in this connection i also believe that special research into the risks is important and , moreover , that we should ensure that the research is independent , i.e. that we do not base our political initiatives on the producers ' own research . 
where research is concerned , we also know that international cooperation is important , including cooperation with the united states and japan . 
as part of future legislation on chemical substances , i believe it would be a good thing if we succeeded in establishing a special framework , some special chapters on endocrine disrupters . 
there must be a legislative framework that is based on the precautionary principle and on the principle of a reverse burden of proof . 
at the same time , a timetable should be set for the testing of existing substances . 
in suggesting a legislative framework , i am also saying that i believe the rules should be binding . 
all experience of voluntary agreements in this area is poor . 
madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and i hope that we can work swiftly on this important problem . 
i agree with the rapporteur that it is frightening , particularly the effects on generations to come and the effects on unborn children . 
in recent decades , growing evidence has accumulated on the hormone - like effects of a number of industrial chemicals that have appeared in the environment . 
these substances have been termed endocrine disrupters . 
endocrine disruption is not in itself an adverse outcome but a mechanism , which may have carcinogenic , reproductive , developmental or behavioural effects . 
some of these effects can be detected using current testing procedures even though it may not be clear whether the disorder has been brought about through endocrine disruption . 
the eu scientific committee on toxicity , eco - toxity and the environment has noted that there is a potentially global problem with wildlife . 
equally , the scientific committee 's opinion on human and wildlife health effect. with emphasis on wildlif. said that the health effects on human beings must be investigated because the associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals and human health disturbances need to be verified . 
in general , scientists are suspicious of organochlorine compounds such as pcbs . 
the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy has therefore reached certain conclusions , in particular that all 560 - plus suspected endocrine disrupting substances need to be fully evaluated . 
we need to look at these in the sixth framework programme . 
we need to focus on both women and men . 
we refer to the technical term " oestrogen " as well as " androgen " so it is not just a male problem . 
madam president , commissioner , as regards endocrine disrupters we currently have a lot of doubts , a lot of questions and absolutely no certainties . 
these substances can have excessively harmful effects on reproductive functions , whether they be human , animal or plant . 
my amendment aims to make this reality . 
so , even though there are no certainties , it is much too early to overturn the regulations on responsibility applied to this matter . 
in the case of dangerous substances , authorisation is required before they can be placed on the market . 
it seems to me that this procedure is already a safeguard . 
i agree with the rapporteur that our parliament must send a realistic and responsible message to the general public , to consumers , to the commission and also to industry in general . 
their doubts and concerns are real . 
we must provide a commensurate response . 
mr president , i represent the north - west of england which , with the cities of manchester and liverpool , is i suppose one of the most densely populated parts of the european union . 
the evidence of falling sperm counts , of rising levels of breast cancer , of female polar bears growing penises or whatever gives rise to very real fears and we have to be prepared to ban some substances on suspicion alone , even before we have firm scientific evidence . 
in my view , this should be put right during the revision of the pesticide directive in 2003 at the latest . 
i think anyone listening to this debate who has never heard of endocrine disrupters would be forgiven for thinking that endocrine disrupters were more to do with some science fiction horror story than their own public health . 
yet the reality is that this is a critical public health and animal health issue . 
presently , community chemicals legislation fails to address the risk that endocrine disrupters pose . 
it is a worrying fact that the human body contains more than 100 chemicals which were not present 50 years ago . 
numerous female health problems have been linked to exposure to endocrine - disrupting substances . 
more information , more public awareness and , most importantly , more research is what is needed . 
i thank the rapporteur for this report and i recommend it to the house . 
first i would like to express my appreciation for the parliament response to the commission communication on a community strategy for endocrine disrupters and for the work of the rapporteur , mr lund . 
there is hardly any conference on the topic of chemicals that does not touch on the subject of endocrine disrupters . 
what we do know is that a number of man - made chemicals that have been released into the environment , as well as a few natural ones , have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals , including humans . 
among these are persistent bio - accumulative compounds that include some pesticides and industrial chemicals as well as other synthetic products . 
many wildlife populations are already affected by these compounds . 
there are adequate quantitative data showing a causal link between exposure to these substances and a reduction in reproductive success in wildlife . 
there are also some general conclusions that have been drawn by the research community such as the fact that the chemicals concerned have entirely different effects , as mr arvidsson said , on embryos , foetuses and perinatal organisms than on adults and that effects are more often manifested in offspring , rather than in a parent that has suffered exposure . 
however , there are also many uncertainties since the nature and extent of the effects of exposure on humans are not well established . 
i am pleased that parliament supports the commission objective to identify appropriate policy action on the basis of the precautionary principle in order to respond quickly and effectively to the problem of endocrine disruption . 
at the same time we need to take into account existing scientific evidence . 
that is why we make provision in the short term to act without agreed test methods on the basis of the precautionary principle and on a case - by - case basis . 
parliament supports the commission objective to identify a first set of endocrine disrupting substances by the end of this year and to identify specific cases of consumer use and eco - system exposure for special action without awaiting further tests . 
an analysis of existing legal instruments relating to endocrine disrupters will also be part of this exercise . 
let me make two comments on this . 
first , the commission objective of the end of 2000 is based on a two - step process : firstly a candidate list compiled by consultants and secondly prioritisation . 
commission adoption of a proposal for prioritisation will follow . 
so far , only the candidate list has been completed . 
the second step of this exercise involves consultation with stakeholders in which we aim to achieve as wide a consensus as possible on priority substances . 
i cannot give a commitment now that all 553 candidate substances will be on the priority list without pre - empting the outcome of the stakeholders ' discussions , which are under way . 
the scientific committee as well as industry have been critical of the candidate list , the bkh report . 
in contrast , initial comments received from member states and ngos indicate support for the report as a valid starting point . 
finally , as you are aware , the commission intends to present a white paper on the overall chemicals policy by the end of this year . 
we are working on that right now and i have seen the first drafts . 
one of the fundamental principles for this policy is to ensure a high level of protection . 
clearly the endocrine disrupting strategy must be consistent with the overall policy on chemicals . 
a number of specific elements in parliament 's motion for a resolution , such as the shifting of the burden of proof , a redefinition of the responsibility of manufacturers , a review of labelling legislation and grouping of chemicals for screening and testing , must be and are being addressed in the context of this overall chemicals policy . 
the views of parliament expressed in the motion for a resolution will be taken into account in the white paper under preparation . 
finally , regarding international cooperation and information exchange , the commission is organising a workshop on endocrine disrupters in the first half of 2001 with the sponsorship of the world health organisation among others . 
this workshop will convene all stakeholders to take stock of progress and make further recommendations on the development of test methods and testing strategy , research and the establishment of monitoring programmes . 
i should again like to thank parliament for its support in addressing this issue and i would like to underline the commission 's commitment to implementation of its strategy and to taking on board the elements of the parliament motion for a resolution in a comprehensive way . 
madam president , the commission has presented a proposal which , under the semblance of a technical adjustment , conceals new budget restrictions for a sector itself already discriminated against within the common agricultural policy . 
in recent years , fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and other circumstances have brought the level of aid down to half the level it was at four years ago . 
before the end of the year , the commission is to submit a report on the operation of the com on fruit and vegetables , possibly supplementing it with new proposals for reform . 
therefore , if there is any urgency , it lies in encouraging the pooling of supply within producer groups . 
since this is an exception in the common agricultural policy and the producers themselves have to cofinance the operational funds , an increase in community funding is clearly the most obvious instrument for achieving this objective . 
the agriculture committee has therefore proposed an increase in the percentage of community financing for certain joint schemes involving several producer organisations under certain conditions , especially in the regions most dependent on fruit and vegetable production , or for associations or mergers of producer organisations . 
the aid requested by the agriculture committee may seem excessively high , but we must not allow ourselves to be deceived . 
what is happening is that the aid levels proposed by the commission are excessively low and are intended to convert a temporary situation into something permanent , thus eroding farmers ' incomes . 
this temporary situation has been brought about by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and particular events on the markets . 
furthermore , on the subject of aid , the disappearance of the minimum price and paying aid directly through producer organisations may cause problems , particularly in the main fruit and vegetable producing countries . 
a reasonable level of aid would allow producers ' incomes to be maintained in a particularly difficult situation . 
to avoid absurd situations of systematic penalisation , the agriculture committee has decided to propose setting it at the level of what was produced in recent years . 
in this way we hope to tailor the aid to the production structure and the ability of the market to absorb the supply , without running the risk of creating surpluses . 
one may ask how the amendments will be financed . 
madam president , commissioner , tomorrow parliament is to vote on the proposal for reform in the processed fruit and vegetable sector . 
i believe this reform is necessary , but in its proposal the european commission is not moving in exactly the right direction . 
the objective of promoting supply pooling must be met by encouraging producer organisations . 
last year , as mr jové peres has said , only 40 % of production was marketed through producer associations . 
therefore , the amendments approved by the agriculture committee and rural development , under which up to 50 % of the costs of creation and operation can be cofinanced under the eaggf guarantee for the first five years , answer a need , commissioner , as does covering the financial aid of 3 to 4.5 % , as approved by the agriculture committee , of the produce marketed by each producer organisation . 
we are not happy with the thresholds proposed by the european commission , since they should be adjusted in accordance with market fluctuations . 
therefore the approved amendments proposed by the rapporteur on this matter enjoy our full approval . 
the list of products should be extended to include those that may be vulnerable to major falls in prices due to the weather or for cyclical reasons . 
certain instruments for regulating the market in emergency crisis situations must be introduced to act as a safety net , for example , by exceeding the withdrawal ceiling by about 10 % in the event of serious crises . 
there is a gap in the area of labelling . 
the analysis of the reforms , which the agriculture committee and rural development has so insistently called for , should be submitted by 30 june 2001 so that we can see how the sector has been performing . 
these reforms mean a budget increase , but within the line approved at the berlin european summit . 
madam president , commissioner , when developing any strategy , before starting to distort the past and adopt new operating guidelines , one must analyse how much has been achieved . 
it would now seem to be irrefutable that since 199. the year which saw a complete revision of the com in processed fruit and vegetable. there has not been any form of discussion , even though it had always been intended , on the impact of the com in that sector , despite the fact that it has reached its third year of application : a period of time that has to be seen as long enough for introducing any reform initiative . 
the interests of an entire industry are at stake , an industry which employs almost 2 million people in the central southern areas of the mediterranean countries , universally acknowledged to be among the poorest countries in the european union . 
the fruit and vegetable sector is struggling between production quotas and world - wide liberalisation of the markets for want of a policy for research into biotechnological innovations . 
it is the processing sector which feels the effects of the marrakech international agreements most of all , even though it accounts for 16 % of the value of european union agricultural production . 
the second point i would like to highlight is the position of the producers . 
for in the present commotion caused by buying - in organisations which operate on behalf of supermarkets , the question could gradually arise of whether there might not be too much merging and amalgamating on the part of these organisations , and of whether the latter might not slowly but surely be securing monopoly positions for themselves . 
there is only one possible answer to this : the producer organisations need to adopt a more powerful stance and improve the way in which they are organised . 
in my view , this would be more effective than injecting more money into the sector . 
the sector must secure a stronger market position . 
and i must also say that , in my view , this is more effective , especially with regard to vegetables and fruit , as well as delicate products which need to be sold quickly . 
i would like to make a number of observations with regard to the distribution of processing and threshold quotas across the countries . 
i have noticed that these are not evenly distributed on a number of counts . 
and i am also expecting the rapporteur to produce an oral amendment tomorrow with regard to at least one of the countries involved in the processing of pears . 
but if you consider the distribution across the southern countries , for example the position of portugal compared to other countries , one can ask oneself whether this distribution is even in every respect . 
while we have a common organisation of the market and claim , on the one hand , that we do not want more money injected into it , this will only be effective if we , on the other hand , also consider the production side and possibly a certain level of control of this . 
but in this report , i am precisely in favour of strengthening producer organisations , also by way of responding to this report . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on 12 july the commission presented a proposal for amending the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables , although we are expecting an evaluation report from the commission in december 2000 on functioning of this very market organisation . 
if we change some points now in anticipation of that , the commission will then have to use this evaluation immediately to review the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and make the necessary changes . 
joining together producer groups and forming producer associations , and commercial cooperation between producer organisations from various regions , are all particularly important for the fruit and vegetables market sector . 
this should be the starting point for the com . 
nevertheless , we also have to bear in mind those farmers who energetically sell part of their production direct to consumers from their farms , for the benefit of themselves and their families . 
for many farms , direct sales bring much - needed additional income , and they are often run by farmers ' wives as an independent part of the business . 
furthermore , direct sales from the farm emphasise the regional nature of products and thus appeal to a certain type of consumer . 
the amendment to article 11 ( 1 ) ( c ) must therefore be framed in such a way that producers , in agreement with producer groups , can sell a proportion of their product. to be agreed on a case - by - case basi. direct to consumers for their personal use . 
if the present rigid limit is maintained , producer organisations will be obliged to expel members who do not respect these rules . 
international trade agreements are to some extent at the expense of this fruit and vegetable sector and therefore benefit other sectors . 
i believe that this additional financial restriction will be hard to cope with and i hope that the commissioner , the commission and the council will have the insight to make sure that a third handicap is not added to the two existing ones simply because of a desire to make additional savings in a particular way here , and that parliament 's wishes and proposals and those of the rapporteur and of the committee on agriculture and rural development will be taken into account . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , before i go into the details of the report , i would like to thank both mr jové perez for his report , and the members of the committee for the time and effort they have devoted to the 61 amendments . 
one thing is clear to me : as with any totally new system , the practical experience that we have gained in recent years suggests that the market organisation for fruit and vegetables must be the subject of a review as well , and it must also be fine - tuned . 
amendments nos 1, 2, 44 and 19 relate to strengthening the role of the producer organisations , amendments nos 8, 14, 26, 27 and 35 relate to increased support for peripheral regions and less favoured regions , and to trade measures ; amendments nos 17, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56 and 59 relate to reporting arrangements for the com . 
amendments nos 3 and 4 are about an increase in eu appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector . 
as i see it , none of these general comments on the com has any place in the proposal before us , because they anticipate the proposal that we are still considering , and should therefore be discussed in conjunction with this report . 
amendment no 18 is intended to improve the scope for direct sales , and amendments nos 22 to 24 relate to the operational fund . 
amendments nos 28 to 30, 33, 36, 37 and 38 concern inter - branch organisations , nuts and withdrawal . 
as with the first group of amendment , the proposal we are discussing today is not the right place for these amendments and i cannot therefore accept them . 
but i do admit that both groups contain some interesting points which the commission will carefully consider in relation to the reports to be presented by the year end. i would like to point out that a proposal to the council adopted on 5 october already covers consideration of an increase in appropriations for nuts . 
the third group of amendments does relate to the proposal actually being debated here . 
amendments nos 6 and 25 propose an increase in community support via the operational funds . 
the aim of amendments nos 31 and 32 is to strike out the reductions in market withdrawal ceilings proposed by the commission . 
amendments nos 67 and 68 address water consumption , and amendments nos 9, 11, 15, 16, 40, 41, 51, 53, 57, 60 and 61 in various ways propose increases or changes in processing thresholds and aid for tomatoes , peaches , pears , and citrus fruits . 
amendment no 39 proposes simplification of the procedure for adjusting new products in the processing sector . 
amendment no 43 relates to transitional arrangements for tomatoes and amendment no 12 calls for a study on the abolition of the minimum price . 
lastly , amendments nos 62 to 66 provide for direct aids for producers not involved in processing . 
most of the amendments in this group would result in an increase in appropriations which in some cases would be substantial , and are thus very much at odds with the principle of budget neutrality . 
i cannot therefore accept these amendments . 
of course the issue of the overall level of community financing for this sector is also to be discussed by the council on monday . 
i am sure that these discussions will continue , and that this point will also be an important part of the final decision on this proposal . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m . 
from that point of view , the one thing that has changed dramatically in recent times is that there is a growing understanding that such protection is necessary . 
perhaps five years ago if you told fishermen in that particular area that there was a need for this , they would have said there was no need for it . 
this report also requires technical changes : to the mesh size of nets . 
what is the use of integrated coastal zone management , which we will be discussing shortly , when what structurally weak coastal regions need is a new kind of self - image and above all modern jobs ? 
however , this can only work if the problems of the origin principle and of recrimination , powers and responsibilities can finally be solved at all levels . 
meaningful , technically verifiable measures need to be introduced . 
we need binding sanctions , and we need member states that exercise their right to check origin , even if doing that hits their pockets . 
in addition , three things are needed : political will , fishermen who think like businessmen , and the interaction of consumers and entrepreneurs in the market place . 
the rapporteur does mention compensation , but i say this with some caution : compensation is a slippery slope . 
it can provide short - term solutions for a longer - term problem . 
it must be remembered that by definition any technical measure involves some restriction on the activity . 
i think it is worth making this point clear , because it is obvious that any technical measure means an economic loss for fishermen , either directly or indirectly . 
if this is the criterion that must be followed , it is also clear that if measures such as those proposed are subsidised , then subsidies will also have to be given to any others deriving from a modification of technical measures which would result in changes in the use of fishing techniques or methods , in other words virtually all the reforms under the technical measures regulation . 
commissioner , i should really like you to clarify this point , seeing that article 16 ( 2 ) is open to all kinds of interpretations . 
i should like to know what interpretation the commission gives to article 16 ( 2 ) . 
thank you , madam president , and i forgo one minute of my time this evening , which is getting rather long for everyone . 
madam president , i congratulate mr nicholson on his excellent report . 
he pointed out that in order to be effective such measures require the support of fishermen and scientists who live and work in an area . 
this may well prove to be a vital trail - blazer for the strategy of devolved management of fisheries which all of us have been discussing in the context of the reform of the cfp . 
it has become increasingly evident that fishermen and scientists working in a specific fishery will more readily adhere to rules and regulations that they themselves have conceived , rather than brussels hand - me - downs . 
the major fisheries organisations in the u. the scottish fishermen 's federation and the national federation of fishermen 's organisation. which , between them represent the interests of 1900 vessels , both support the concept of zonal management . 
fishermen are also deeply concerned that such rules and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently by fishing vessels from different member states . 
that is why again , zonal fisheries management which involves all fishermen working in a common fishery will ensure that the rules are applied fairly and squarely across the board . 
this report is timely , as cod stocks are not only diminishing rapidly in the irish sea but are in spiral decline around all the waters of the united kingdom . 
some years ago when the house of commons in london drew up an agreement which effectively ended the cod war between the uk and iceland , it was famously referred to as " the piece of cod which passeth all understanding " . 
hopefully this report will mark the beginning of the recovery of cod stocks in the irish sea and will pave the way to the future . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to offer my heartfelt thanks to mr nicholson for his excellent report . 
at the same time , i would like to reassure him that i am perfectly willing to listen to fishermen , especially as i shall be in ireland the week after next and will be fostering close contacts and entering into discussions with the fishermen there , and with the entire sector . 
you are already very familiar with this proposal , so i believe i do not need to present it again here . 
i will therefore move straight on to the amendments tabled and i unfortunately have to say that i have some problems with them . 
there are two reasons why the commission cannot accept amendments nos 3 and 4, which relate to compensatory aid . 
first , this document is about technical measures , and a document on technical measures is not the right place for provisions on compensatory aid . 
second , and even more importantly , there are member states who have to decide under regulation 27 / 97 whether they will offer fishermen compensatory aid for temporarily withdrawing from fishing activity or not . 
the other two amendments , amendments nos 1 and 2, address a future review of the regulation and the commission finds them difficult for the following reasons : first , the fact that everyon. the commission , member states ' administrations and also fishermen themselve. want the regulation to come into force on 1 january 2001 . 
in my opinion , any delay in this entry into force is to be avoided . 
madam president , i mentioned that i am going to irelan. and i am also visiting scotland , by the wa. and i have left it to the governments and the various authorities there to put together my programme and also to decide which fishermen i should meet there . 
please do not in any way get involved in that type of situation . 
fishing is something on which we all cooperate , in both the north and south of the island . 
do not try to make it a political point of view . 
what is important for consumers is that the regulation should enter into force immediately from the start of the year . 
the matter is very urgent , as free price competition in local networks is one of the cornerstones of europe and , more generally the development of the european information society . 
i am particularly satisfied that parliament , the council and the commission were able to work in such close cooperation in this matter and that they treated this complex issue , discussing it constructively , in an atmosphere of understanding that was perhaps unprecedented . 
for the commission this is an important and very successful achievement , it must be said . 
we have now a record in a field in which developments come so fast that records befit it rather well . 
opening up local networks to competition is a " fast - track " opportunity afforded by the treaty of amsterdam , which we are now taking full advantage of , as , otherwise , every day we will be losing money in the shape of exorbitant charges and creating barriers to the process . 
in just a few weeks we in the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy have dealt with this issue and have , under the leadership of the rapporteur , succeeded in negotiating this proposal with the commission and the council , a proposal that must surely be adopted tomorrow without amendment . 
already things are moving in such a way that an oligopolistic situation is developing , which will result in the market being carved up directly . 
it was the case in holland , and just recently in italy , that the number of players taking part in auctions was only equivalent to the number of licences available . 
this is therefore a matter of a sort of private agreement , which means that the market can no longer function properly . 
i believe it is important to ensure that the changes take place in a controlled way , to allow all players involved the time to adjust and to guarantee the rights of all consumers . 
it is clear that we must all support the upgrading of existing telecommunications infrastructures so that we can take advantage of evolving new technologies . 
in my country we are determined that our telecommunications infrastructure be of the highest standard in order to secure new investment into the country . 
investment in our infrastructure is a critical component to the continued success and growth of the irish economy ; in particular , ireland is aiming to become a world centre of e - commerce . 
at the same time it is essential that all citizens be guaranteed the same benefits from the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructures . 
the opening - up of the local copper networks to provide competition must lead to all local networks being upgraded in all towns and indeed in all villages . 
we must avoid cherry - picking by new entrants who might wish to upgrade only networks in the bigger urban areas . 
on the question of fair price , the price charge for access to the local loop must be allowed to reflect sunken costs in addition to a margin for reinvestment . 
madam president , commissioner , the lisbon extraordinary european council set a basic strategic objective for the european union : that of becoming ' the most competitive and dynamic knowledge - based economy in the world ' . 
for this statement to become reality , it must be followed by measures to liberalise the markets , promote competition and thereby open up access for new suppliers of telecommunications services and in particular internet services . 
in my opinion , the commission and the european authorities have always been consistent with the lisbon declarations : i refer , for example , to the proposal for a directive on e - commerce which , with the objective or the excuse of removing a form of discrimination against european producers who distribute information services will , in the end , be penalising the development of e - commerce throughout the whole of europe . 
this is a matter on which we are , however , moving swiftly and , it would appear , genuinely in the right direction . 
our rapporteur , mr clegg , has done a good job , making the commission 's proposal clearer and more specific and setting out the necessary conditions for that rapid conclusion of the legislative process which so many of us hope for and for which we too will vote tomorrow . 
i would , however , like to take this opportunity to warn the commission that , once this regulation has been adopted , other obstacles will have to be tackled if the ' last mile ' of the telecommunications sector is to be genuinely liberalised as well . 
in my country , italy , the conditions for the liberalisation of the last mile have existed for a long time , but the national telecommunications authority has delayed practical implementation , in particular with regard to fixing price charges for access to the local loop . 
in the case of italy , but also other european countries , this is probably due to the powerful position of the incumbent operator , which is trying to put off the move for as long as possible . 
there are parties who have much to lose and , in italy , there is a conflict of interests between the state as regulator and the state as owner or controller of some of the main telecommunications services companies . 
the regulation is intended to provide for competition in this " last mile " . 
only by ensuring that there is true competition in this market segment can we guarantee rapid and low - cost access to the internet and to multimedia applications in the long term . 
this is not only the dream of every internet user , it is also an urgent necessity in the era of the new economy . 
the reality in large parts of europe is at present very different , so that dialling into the net is expensive , telephone lines are engaged while surfing the internet , surfing is costly , and there are long waiting times . 
according to the latest studies , at the beginning of 2000 only 400 000 europeans had access to broadband services , compared with 3 million in the usa . 
the european commission has therefore rightly decided to lend a hand her. and quickly . 
in my opinion there is no other alternative politically speaking but to approve the regulation in its present form and thus remove the final bottleneck . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks to nicholas clegg also for his hard work . 
to give one light - hearted example , his compromise proposals reached me when i was on the way home on the motorway . 
of course i pulled over , in accordance with the law , and then discussed them further with him . 
this shows how we worked on this and i think that this was superb . 
we are also willing to do this again in future , but we could do with a bit more time now and again to discuss particular points in still greater depth . 
our political objective was to enhance competition and so smooth the path to the information society . 
this regulation is intended to achieve a marked improvement in competition in the local access network , with the aim , for example , of giving internet services better access to the mass market , so that market penetration will increase . 
this initiative will ultimately also help to promote the information society . 
but quicker and cheaper internet access without content is worthless . 
above all , the information society must mean investment in people and their skills . 
one important point is that the regulation regulates in the spirit of the original telecommunications liberalisation , that is in an asymmetrical way . 
this has certainly demonstrated its value when it comes to improving competition . 
but this regulation will be superseded in future and we will move on to a new regulatory framework under competition law.in view of that , i would say that amendment no 13 is particularly important , as it provides for a new recital 10 ( a ) which emphasises once again that a new regulatory framework will replace this regulation in the not too distant future . 
of at least equal importance is the fact that the council is not holding up the telecommunications regulatory package . 
i also trust that the council will adopt it soon and that we will continue the consultation procedure on the rest of the package quickly and in a serious manner . 
i hope that the council will not leave us in the lurch should one or other member state perhaps still have reservations . 
our work should set an example here . 
we have reached agreement quickly and effectively , and i hope that the council will follow suit . 
i remind the commissioner that one of the other key aspects of lisbon was the creation of new conditions in the european economy , to get the new investors . 
can i encourage him with the new spirit of adventure that we see her. and perhaps that is not a word that we always associate with the commissio. to move forward with zeal and vigour to achieve these other aspects of lisbon with the same effectiveness . 
can i start by congratulating mr clegg on the speed and quality of his work and also welcoming him to this rather exclusive band of members who so often are here late at night debating telecommunications issues . 
we have more legislation ahead of us and we have to learn the lessons from so much of the legislation with which we have been jointly involved over many years in the past . 
commissioner , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , behind the somewhat barbaric name of the proposal for a regulation which we are debating this evening , unbundling access to the local loop , an expression moreover which is totally impenetrable for the average citizen , there lies a simple yet serious decision regarding the liberalisation of the local network of voice telephony and data transmission services . 
as we have heard this evening , for some in this house , the closing of the final chapter of a public monopoly can only lead to an automatic reduction in the costs of local communications and this can therefore only be positive for consumers . 
for others , including me , this is far from being quite so obvious and , above all , quite so automatic . 
if unregulated competition always leads to a permanent reduction in prices , and always benefits each and every consumer everywhere , this would have happened long ago . 
moreover , the example of mobile telephony , which is completely open to competition , proves precisely the opposite . 
real prices of calls from mobiles continue to be high and the transparency of costs and prices is far from being guaranteed . 
all things considered , madam president , as the three european institutions are in agreement on uncoupling , i will not be more catholic than the pope , and i shall therefore be voting in favour tomorrow . 
madam president , commissioner , i have before me the documents we will be voting on this week . 
we know that umts will provide us with a new service . 
the environment and telecommunications will in future play a very special role in international competitiveness . 
that is why i think it is important to create a level playing field . 
this directive in particular demonstrates that we have been very thorough in aiming for fairness , and this has been a model of how to legislate , with a review , with a proper and thorough examination , with all stakeholders being consulted , and , lastly , a good , efficient , swift and precise procedure in the european parliament . 
once again , i would like to express my very sincere thanks ! 
madam president , it falls to me to be the one who cries wolf on this occasion . 
i do not normally take a position in this house which is based purely on national considerations but it seems to me that we are attempting to put in place a regulation which is inflexible and does not take into account the position of the market in ireland . 
the proposal that we have will oblige eirecom , a private limited company , a former state monopoly , to open up its local loop to alternative providers and will not oblige alternative providers already in the market place such as cable tv , satellite and wireless local loop operators to do the same . 
they are excluded from the scope of this regulation . 
cable tv companies in ireland already possess the network and are already gearing up their network to provide telephony , internet and other interactive services . 
in many cases they operate large and exclusive franchise areas . 
in the case of ireland , penetration rates by these companies in the larger cities and towns is of the order of 90 % , far exceeding those of eirecom plc. it is impossible to understand and entirely unacceptable that the proposal does not also encompass these tv cable companies . 
in addition , fixed network operators such as eirecom will find it impossible to compete with these companies which are providing bundled services to customers , which often include internet access and free local calls as part of their standard bundle of service offerings . 
clearly where an alternative competing network coexists with a copper network , either all should be unbundled or none . 
this will be consistent with the stated justification for unbundling put forward by the commission . 
at the same time we must remember that this is one side of the coin . 
on the other side , we need people with skills and qualifications who can use these services . 
i should just like to mention three of those . 
madam president , my intervention refers to the situation in the ivory coast . 
madam president , as we do every year and in every budgetary procedure , we will of course have to start by voting on a few additional technical adjustments . 
last - minute negotiations have been held with all the groups and , in my capacity as rapporteur , i should like to table a number of technical corrections on five points . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the administrative budgets are rather less complicated in this respect , but here too we may need to make a technical adjustment , depending on what the house decides today . 
i should like to ask you also to support our making the necessary adjustments to budget line a - 206, acquisition of immovable property , depending on which amendments are adopted , so that we do not exceed our self - imposed ceiling of 20 % of total administrative expenditure . 
i believe that this is customary in the house and i would be grateful if you could support this proposal . 
i have received a motion for outright rejection of the general budget for 2001 tabled by mr wurtz . 
madam president , we already know the result of the coming vote , but we wanted to put down a marker . 
the basic problem our resolution addresses is going to remain with us throughout the budgetary procedure and beyond . 
so , if our fears are confirmed , and whatever the vote today , i just hope all members who share our ambitions for europe will join us in the fray . 
( parliament rejected the motion ) - before the vote on draft amendment no 19 
madam president , we voted in block 1 . 
the vote concerns an amendment tabled by the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party to increase the tobacco subsidy by eur 5 million . 
yet , i have noticed that proposals have also been moved here to reduce the budget . 
i fail to see the connection between the two , and furthermore , it escapes me completely that in block 1, this increase was proposed by the liberals , and that under amendments nos 6, 4 and 9, a number of the members of the same liberal group subsequently proposed scrapping the budget altogether . 
in the matter of the external measures in category 4, we have chosen to vote according to a line which does not require revision of the financial perspective . 
it is particularly important to be able to offer subsidies for improving the situation in serbia . 
to request a revision of the financial perspective at this stage would be unfortunate . 
parliament should therefore act to maintain the interinstitutional agreement and to keep the budget within the framework of the budget plan . 
we believe that funds for the balkans can instead be taken from the programmes in category 4 that are sadly not fully utilised at present . 
funds can also be released through mobilisation of the flexibility instrument . 
we must dedicate ourselves to upholding the european ideals of inclusiveness and democracy and resist the pressure of those groups that wish to maintain an anti - european monopolistic control . 
-- ( sv ) we feel that the ceiling for the budget must absolutely not be exceeded . 
to obtain sufficient economic funds for increased aid to the balkans , the member states must reallocate funds from the available budget . 
we feel that , if the member states have the will , they will be able to find available funds that are not being utilised in the budget being worked on today . 
. ( it ) the members of parliament belonging to the lega nord voted against the draft budget not because they oppose the idea of europe but because they wanted to show their disapproval of the distorted way that this idea is being put into practice . 
if fine words have led the citizens to believe that the union was attentive to their demands , their requirements and their needs , the vote today has proved the contrary . 
ladies and gentlemen , you will all be aware that the west of padania has recently been hit by floods , bringing loss of life and substantial material damage . 
while there is unfortunately nothing that can be done to restore these things , aid measures were necessary and it was our duty to provide them . 
the left party supports the idea that the work in progress for a new statute for members should lead as quickly as possible to a solution in which refunds of travel expenses also reflect the actual costs . 
that is the solution to the proble. not unhelpful comments on the budget . 
-- ( sv ) the community sector in the member states has been subjected to major cut - backs for a number of years . 
in this connection , it is depressing to see that , within the budget of the european union , there is an incredible amount of unutilised resources and that , in certain cases , resources are being downright squandered . 
if the european parliament were now to abolish its friday sittings in strasbourg , for example , this would save eur 1 million . 
the european parliament is also pushing hard for contributions to european political parties to be introduced . 
it is interesting to note that the eu parties are clearly incapable of inducing either their member parties or the individual members of the member parties to pay a fee for membership of the eu party . instead , we are forced to finance the eu parties with public funds . 
that , if anything , demonstrates the low level of motivation that this eu project has , even among politically active citizens . 
otherwise , we make a reservation in respect of the great outflow of funds that is taking place in the eu via agricultural subsidies , regional subsidies , operation of the economic and social committee , etc. the public funds that are being spent by the eu can be better used in the member states . 
rühle report ( a5 - 0251 / 2000 ) 
the arguments for promoting competition imply yet another attack on the public telecommunications sector in an area of basic services that are vital to the public , without any corresponding improvement in the public service provided . 
as the report states , unbundled access to the local loop allows new entrants to compete with notified operators in offering high bit - rate data transmission services for continuous internet access and for multimedia applications based on digital subscriber line technology as well as voice telephony services , using local network infrastructures that have already been installed by other operators , generally public service operators . 
we are voting against this report even if it does seem a mere formality in the process of the liberalisation of telecommunications . 
the amendments add nothing , apart from some further praise for the alleged virtues of competitiveness . 
what ' unbundled access to the local loop ' actually does is force public operators to put the leasing of public telephone lines out to commercial tender as soon as possible . 
so 20 to 30 % of the contracts will again be offered to private competition . 
many have already anticipated this directive , like france telecom . 
as well as the new constraints imposed on staff , particularly in the commercial services sector , inequality in the treatment of users is going to get worse . 
on the pretext of resolving a number of questions relating to fruit and vegetables , the commission is proposing serious amendments to the regulations in question , even before the report has been finalised on the results of the previous regulations , which entered into force as recently as 1997 . 
with processed tomatoes and peaches , it is using direct aid to producers as an excuse to propose abolishing the minimum price . 
this price may not provide satisfactory protection for producers , but it is nonetheless a minimum safety valve . 
there is a lot of money about in the agricultural sector these days , but that does not appear to be a guarantee for a good income or safeguard the future of the business . 
my colleague mr salvador jové is only too aware of the bad position which southern european small farmers and farm labourers find themselves in . 
within the existing structure of extensive agricultural subsidies , he is looking for a majority to reach a compromise which will do more to safeguard the chances of survival of this group of farmers . 
i support his view , as long as this results in income support for those on incomes which are too low . 
if i were to have my way , i would invest less funds in agriculture but within this sector , give more to the poorest . 
this line of thinking is at odds with the idea that europe should collect more taxpayers ' money to subsidise the richest and most profitable businesses . 
the growing dutch glasshouse horticulture , which yields a large volume of vegetables , fruit and flowers in a small space , is in a much stronger position than cereal or dairy farms . 
since it appears from appendix iii that glasshouse horticulture does not benefit from the proposed subsidy scheme for vegetables and fruit , i am putting my objections on hold for the time being . 
i voted in favour of this report because it lives up to the expectations of portuguese organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector , which have called for a drastic overhaul of the com in processed fruit and vegetables , which they consider to be extremely damaging to our national interests . 
i abstained because i feel that in this case , as mr bushill - matthews and the english members have said , there has been a lack of subsidiarity . 
this is a fishing issue that concerns the british , the belgians , the french and the irish . 
i fail to see why they cannot be left to reach a decision on their own concerning their fish and their fishing . 
cushnahan report ( a5 - 0284 / 2000 ) 
madam president , among my many elderly friends in italy and elsewhere there is one chinese man . 
besides , we know the death penalty is not a deterrent , it is quite unacceptable for countries claiming to be civilised ( like the united states ) to continue applying it in a wholesale and systematic manner , running an immense risk of making irreparable legal mistakes . 
that is why i have voted in favour of the call for a moratorium . 
moreira da silva report ( a5 - 0270 / 2000 ) 
the problem of global warming caused by concentrations of gases in the atmosphere which exacerbate the greenhouse effect , such as carbon dioxide , is taking on explosive proportions . 
it is only three years since the kyoto conference and the european environmental agency estimates that , if emissions in the eu continue at present rates , instead of an 8 % reduction in emissions of co2 between 1990 - 2010, there will be a 6 % increase , while in the usa the outlook is even worse . 
the root of the problem lies in the fact that everything , including the quality of the environment and the climate , is sacrificed to capitalist exploitation of wealth - producing resources and excessive profit . 
consequently , what could be more natural than calling for those who caused the problem to pay to resolve it ? 
the commission communication should have been entitled differently , given that it contains no specific policies or measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ; on the contrary , it confines itself , as the rapporteur rightly comments , to merely producing an organisation chart and a vague list of common policies and measures . 
it restates the position that energy taxation or a tax on fossil fuels are the mainstay of the eu strategy to reduce greenhouse gases . 
we disagree with this measure because , whichever way you look at it , the ' polluter pays ' principle is a hypocritical principle and its distorted application will ensure that the entire cost of reducing emissions is passed on directly to consumers , i.e. to the workers . 
given the tremendous pressure to find a solution , one might well discuss the imposition of an energy tax on fossil fuels , but only as a measure to complement an integrated policy of measures to reduce co2 emissions and on the strict condition that the revenue from this tax is used solely to relieve the burden on workers . 
we stand by the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be paid for by the real polluters ( i.e. large - scale industry ) out of their excess profits . 
we are also totally opposed to the immoral and inefficient system of emission trading between companies and countries . 
we fail to understand how it is possible to create an entire market which trades in pollution as a commodity and on which , instead of reducing their own co2 emissions , some companies buy in surplus coverage from other companies which are within their limits . 
of course , in a capitalist system in which everything can be bought and sold , this is bound to happen . 
the member states themselves will need to drastically reduce their emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases by focusing on renewable energy , public transport and reducing traffic levels . 
the boom in the cheap transport of goods by road mainly leads to the polluting industry being relocated from the richer to the poorer countries . 
nuclear energy is not an alternative because that too adds to global warming , emits greenhouse gases and leaves other waste products behind which hardly degrade . 
this money should be spent by bringing into line and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all the 15 member states of the european union . 
we have to tighten the purse strings and only spend what is necessary . 
in summary , the resolution on endocrine disrupters adopted a moment ago illustrates that far too little is known about the harmful effects , that the european parliament would like to see more research done and that measures need to be taken on the basis of the precautionary principle . 
in modern society , with all its consumer goods , such as appliances , we need materials and substances with very specific characteristics . 
everyone , or nearly everyone , accepts and uses these products . 
the substances and materials in these products , however , do carry a risk . 
as everyone knows , life is full of risks and uncertainties . 
the trick is to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a judicious manner . 
science has still not proven beyond reasonable doubt that there is a direct link between these chemical substances and changes in human hormone levels . 
that does not detract from the fact that i am delighted with the interest in this topic . 
the possible effects of these substances are not insignificant . 
if these chemical substances really cause an increase in certain types of cancer , reduce fertility or threaten unborn life , something has to be done about it . 
human life is worth protecting . 
out of precautionary considerations , it is useful to be clear about these substances . 
pursuant to the precautionary principle , the possible harmfulness of dangerous substances , materials and products should be given scientific substance . 
awareness - raising campaigns directed at the public , at consumers and at people in professions which are at risk of exposure to endocrine disrupters ( farmers , industrial and other workers ) must be a basic concern if these efforts are to be a success . 
this frustration is the result of the high charges and length of time involved . 
this leads me to conclude that the effect which the 1997 directive had was inadequate . 
we need to go further . 
the consumer and sme do not benefit enough from the internal market which was completed following the introduction of the euro . 
this is to replace the national format which is already widely in use . 
secondly , to create a european bank number , like the iban , for example . 
it is vital that such harmonised formats are used universally in the euro area . 
however , the banks keep maintaining that this is impossible . 
by way of compromise , i have proposed an amendment in this respect which states that the banks must be ready by 1 january 2002 . 
in this way , as soon as the public actually gets to handle the euro , they can straight away benefit from the change in cross - border credit transfers . 
the banks alone cannot reduce the total cost of transfers more or less to the level of the cost price for domestic payments . 
they need the help of the member states . 
after all , banks have so far been obliged by the member states to notify their central banks of any cross - border payments over eur 12 500, for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics . 
this notification procedure cannot be standardised and is therefore carried out manually . 
a very costly matter indeed which will be rendered completely redundant in one market with one currency . 
after all , they do not keep records in france of how many francs leave paris for auxerre , so why should we ? 
moreover , volume and number of retail payments only form a small percentage of the total number of credit transfers . 
your rapporteur is convinced that there should not be any objections to abolishing the report duties up to the full amount stipulated in the directive , namely eur 50 000 . 
the loss of data for balance of payment reporting statistics brought about by this change is minimal . 
a change related to this is that the money - back guarantee must be increased to eur 50 000 . 
at present , banks are almost rewarded when they lose your money . 
if you transfer eur 30 000 and the bank loses that money , it only has a duty to pay you back eur 12 500 . 
banks should of course not lose any money at all , and they must stand surety for their organisation . 
this is why we propose increasing the money - back guarantee limit up to eur 50 000, the amount stipulated in the directive . 
but it would have been good if we had already made use of the transitional period . 
the many complaints made by incensed members of the public speak for themselves , and i have to say that particularly at this time these are , of course , not likely to increase public acceptance of monetary union . 
the political objective is clear and is supported by the european central bank : what we need is a european payment area within which everything works just as smoothly as it does in a single eu country . 
small customers are just as much part of the internal market as major customers ; there should be no discrimination here . 
i believe , however , that there is also more that the governments must do , and i support the rapporteur 's report . 
at the same time , the reporting requirement for balance of payment statistics should be abolished for small - value cross - border payments for amounts of less than eur 50 000 . 
samples are actually sufficient . 
consumers and companies are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the high costs for cross - border bank transactions in the internal market , which is completely understandable . 
consumers pay far too much for any type of cross - border bank transactions , as well as for cash , credit transfers , credit cards and cheques . 
for large sums , there is a refined network in place in which transfers are carried out as quickly and cheaply as for domestic transactions . 
however , the private individual still cannot rely on sufficient support , a reduction in costs and efficient processing of small amounts . 
i would therefore like to stress once more the need for efficient , safe and cheap services for retail payments in the internal market to go hand in hand with the introduction of the euro . 
the acceptance of the euro also depends greatly on whether consumers and companies are able to use the euro area as an internal payment zone . 
it is crucial for consumers to accept the euro . 
when euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 january 2002, consumers will start to use the euro frequently , and how are we then to explain that there are differences in its use , even though there is one currency and one euro area ? 
the idea that transfers in two participating euro area countries will no longer be considered as an international transaction incurring international costs but as a national transfer , will need to become universally accepted . 
the high bank charges involved in the completion of the internal market constitute a barrier . 
consumers are discouraged from shopping internationally . 
for example , they will not subscribe to a foreign magazine if the international charges amount to double the price of the magazine because of the high bank charges . 
in the free movement of capital involving the single currency , there should not be any restrictions or huge discrepancies . 
the objective must be to establish one single payment area , where cross - border payments are subject to the same conditions and accompanied by the same costs as domestic transactions . 
that , in our eyes , is the only possible and logical consequence of the internal market and a single currency . 
the free movement of people in the euro area requires a flexible labour market . 
now that the switch - over is drawing ever closer , it really is time for action , by banks and member states alike . 
banks must commit to implementing the existing standards for account numbering and payment instructions . 
the interconnections between the computer systems of the various banks in the various member states are poor , hence the need for expensive manual operations to process payments from one national system to another . 
this is not some fiendish ploy by the bankers , just a technical reality temporarily resisting resolution , but bound to evolve in the right direction in time . 
so i think we should put the problem into perspective , especially as cross - border payments represent a very small part of total payments . 
the documents i have looked at put their share as low as 0.2 % to 0.04 % . 
in every case , it is really microscopic . 
yet the european parliament and the commission genuinely attach vast significance to it . 
why is that ? 
the first answer is that the european institutions tend to prioritise everything that is cross - border , which is not surprising , after all . 
of course , in the strict sense that is true , but the naïve reader , the non - specialist , thought that all the costs of cross - border payments would disappear , when in fact foreign exchange commissions only represented a small part of those costs , just a small percentage . 
so now we are facing the consequences of the hard sell of the euro , and that brings me to a conclusion on this issue of cross - border payments , but also , madam president , on the euro generally . 
madam president , the no - frills approach , which typifies mrs peijs , is evident in virtually every paragraph of the present report . 
it is only right that the banking sector should be tackled and given a stiff talking to , for while the most important techniques and standards are in place , there is still no flexibility in sight for cross - border credit transfers for amounts up to eur 50 000 . 
one would almost be inclined to think that none of the commercial banks stand to benefit from modernising their present working methods . 
i endorse the dual - track policy , by means of which the rapporteur hopes to spur the slow banks into action . 
in my view , it is not sufficient to exert pressure via legislative measures . these could prove less effective than putting the pressure on by giving rival alternatives generous elbow - room to transfer money within the euro area . 
the commission might well want to give this latter option serious thought , for i assume that the commission too would prefer to see a reduction in the costs via increased competition . 
on the other hand , the largest item of expenditure in cross - border credit transfers is manual handling , and a decision should be taken quickly to dispense with that . 
just as mrs randzio - plath said , we cannot order banks to reduce charges as a result of political decisions . 
what we can do is compel or put pressure on the european central bank to invite banks to attend immediately a meeting of a working party on standardisation at which decisions could be taken regarding the technical circumstances under which costs could be reduced . 
we are seeing that it is failing to deliver any benefits to the mainstream majority of ordinary people in the euro area . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i too should like to thank our colleague , mrs peijs , very much for her report and for being so persistent in her efforts to achieve results for the public . 
on 1 january 2002, the euro will also become a reality for the public , because then we will have the euro in our pockets . 
today the average fee for transferring eur 100 to another country in the internal market is eur 17.10, many times more than the fees for domestic transfers . 
in the future , the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area , in which there are no exchange - related risks and in which electronic payments with internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course , transferring money from munich to salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from munich to kiel . 
the advantages of the euro need to be demonstrated to the public and also to small and medium - sized businesses , precisely because we are having problems at the moment with the acceptance of the euro and it seems to many as though large companies and banks are benefiting from it , but not the man in the street . 
for me , the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either . 
the proposal by mrs peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table , not to lay down the law , but because we simply cannot increase the pressure any further from the political side . 
neither do we want any price regulation in this sector , but we should at least coordinate this . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all carry our own list of recurrent disappointments we can do nothing about in our heads , but it is a good thing to have a moan about them from time to time just to show that we do not accept the situation and that impotence does not always rhyme with indifference , not yet anyway . 
listening to what some members had to say in committee , members who have been in this house longer than i have , gave me the feeling that this multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship exercise that parliament is going through for the fourth time belongs in that category . 
in substance , people were telling me that good intentions are always welcome but we need to make sure , contrary to what has always happened so far , that the next report on the subject does not have to make the same assessment as the previous one , because nothing has really changed in the position of european businesses . 
so the aim of the text before you today is to transform a pointless compulsory figures test into a promising examination of a freestyle programme where the european union can add value as long as it understands its place and its role in the arrangement . 
the time when the defence of business , especially small and medium - sized business , was like a corporatist battle is long gone , not just because there is only a handful of diehards left who see the world of business through the distorting prism of the class struggle , but above all because , at the start of this third millennium , everyone knows that the issues of employment and social cohesion are crucial for our societies , and business has a pre - eminent role in those issues . 
i have also asked that actions geared to specific groups like women , young people and the social economy sectors be encouraged , not forgetting employee participation in the life of these smes in general . 
smes are the major source of job creation , in terms of both quality and quantity , and they play a crucial role in social cohesion and regional planning . 
that is why it is very urgent to remove the many obstacles to their development and organise the necessary training . 
so , mrs montfort , i hope a massive vote for your report will finally allow us to make a qualitative leap forward in this area , and also that certain excessively liberal amendments will be rejected , for instance , on reducing the number of promotional programmes and on creating a new monitoring centre . 
if i had to sum it up in a nutshell , mr president , i would say that what we need here - and if i say so mysel. is less ideology and more action . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first and foremost like to express a word of thanks to the rapporteur who has indeed compiled her report with great care . 
this care is more than needed if we want to establish ' enterprise europe ' by 2005 and if we want to make the european union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge - driven economy in the world . 
the amendment to the report in the committee , partly tabled at my proposal , emphasised that the multiannual programme must be used as an instrument to promote economic growth , full employment and social cohesion . 
i would like to stress that this is an important focus , which must be brought more to the fore in the information and information campaigns , because it cannot be emphasised enough that entrepreneurship and an entrepreneurial climate are both of key significance , and that this is the reason why particular attention must be paid to the education and training of young people , as well as to providing permanent training to staff of smes . 
today , i would particularly like to make a case for systematically eliminating as many as possible , if not all , barriers which stand in the way of establishing the internal market , and for optimising the competitiveness of smes , allowing them to develop in a dynamic and sustained manner . 
in addition , i have always been an advocate of underpinning these goals with efficient and pragmatic policy . 
in our union , this should in the first instance translate into simplification of customs formalities , because the fiscal , social , administrative and regulatory disparities between the member states in terms of costs constitute a substantial barrier to equal access to the internal market . 
finally , i would also urge you to take into consideration the enlargement of the european union which is upon us . 
the effective implementation of the acquis is necessary to ensure that enlargement becomes a win - win situation for the member states and candidate countries alike . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first i , too , would like to congratulate our colleague , mrs elisabeth montfort , on the quality of her report on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for 2001 - 2005 . 
she has studied the proposals with great care , and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned . that approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme . 
through their contacts wit. often publi. research laboratories they undoubtedly supplement public funding , which frequently needs supplementing , and enables discoveries to be made . 
so it is important to make sure our action here is positive . 
turning now to smis / smes and micro - enterprises . 
as mr caudron said , these represent 98 % of our economic fabric . 
our greatest potential for adaptation resides in them . 
they are the true economic and innovation vanguard , in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain . 
we should take special care of them and make sure there are concrete measures which they can assimilate easily . 
the hallmark of this european aid network should be a number of centres , like the euro info centres . 
for an sme / smi , working with this european network would undoubtedly mean that , where synergies exists , it would not have to form a consortium with several other businesses in different union countries , which often results in an artificial set - up with masses of paperwork and endless complications . 
i really hope the commission will set up a working group on this topic , involving interested members of parliament . 
fourthly , there are the proposals for the european research area we are beginning to construct . 
in parallel , we propose to introduce a european innovation area , and i am grateful to mrs montfort for having agreed to include that proposal in her report . 
we must take account of the results of and follow - up to the work of the science and governance conference held last week in brussels under the auspices of the seville institute for prospective technological studies , because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today . 
our president , mrs fontaine , is asking us , because we are responsible for stoa , to send a message of support today to the epta , an organisation specialised in technological assessment in europe , founded under the aegis of our colleague mr barón crespo , which is meeting in berlin on 10 november . 
but stoa is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject . 
mrs montfort , our group will give your report its wholesale support . 
mr president , commissioner , small and medium - sized businesses , both in the manufacturing and in the service sectors , can only survive on the market if they have full order books . 
i think that we in the european parliament have a responsibility to the overall economy which takes precedence over our responsibility to the business economy . 
mr president , this multiannual programme provides a european framework for the development of the innovative potential and the competitiveness of industry in the member states . 
in this context , the principle of subsidiarity is afforded the attention it deserves in our view . 
we endorse the attention which the rapporteur , mrs montfort , is payin. rightly s. to small and medium - sized businesses , and micro - enterprises , as well as to granting priority support to young fledgling entrepreneurs . 
whichever way , the commission has a stimulating role to play in exchanging regional experience and best practices in this field . 
we have always been in favour of eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles for industry . 
in our opinion , a third point of concern is the protection of intellectual property rights at european level . 
we especially have the patenting of software innovation in mind . 
enterprises need clarity . 
in other words : is there still any purpose in investing in this sector ? 
in this context , the question also arises as to whether europe is possibly lagging behind the us precisely because of the lack of a european patent on software . 
my contact there is magister leitner , and if i come across a problem related to support programmes or a problem with the european institutions , then i can tell my employers that there is someone there who is competent and in the know , someone who can give information in the shortest possible time about public calls for tender , support programmes or research on infrastructure . 
this is excellent for europe because help can be given quickly and competently in the form of technically correct information . 
it is extremely important , particularly for small companies , for help to be given quickly . 
for small companies , the three or six months which they have to wait for a piece of information to be forthcoming or for a programme to start is an endlessly long time . 
this means that the smaller the company , the more rapidly everything happens , and with new technologies everything is of course happening even more quickly . 
we all know that the pace at which we live our lives has become faster because we use mobile telephones , e - mail and the internet , and this opens up entirely new possibilities . 
that is why it is important where financing is concerned for us also to ensure that companies have access to the capital market , not only to the stock market . 
above all , when a one - man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project , it should not need to provide 120 % loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing ; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea . 
unfortunately , we are still a long way from this way of thinking in europe . 
what we still need are more experts to guide our companies through complex procedures at european level . 
i will not say what it does , that might constitute an advertisement , but it was founded by my father , francis chichester , and i am very proud of it . 
it also enables me to come here and do my work for my constituents . 
i would like to welcome any measures , like this proposal and this report , that indicate our support at european level for the importance of smes and small businesses in particular . 
i would like to congratulate mrs montfort on all her hard work in her report which , as we have heard , commands wide support across the house . 
in my view , the best thing for small businesses is for the authorities to leave them alone and to desist from the temptation of trying to pick winners . 
this is something that the committee on industry needs to do on a regular basis from now on . 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place today at 6 p.m . 
action plan for albania and the neighbouring region 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0287 / 2000 ) by mrs karamanou , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the draft action plan for albania and neighbouring regions [ 7886 / 200 . 
c5 - 0305 / 200 . 
2000 / 2158 ( cos ) ] . 
mr president , the conclusions of the european council in tampere stress the need to cooperate with countries of origin and transit of migrants and refugees and , within this framework on the council 's instructions , the high - level working group on asylum and migration has drawn up six action plans , one of which is the plan for albania and the neighbouring region . 
clearly , the basic objective of the plan is to stem migration towards the member states of the european union and repatriate illegal immigrants living in the union . 
most of the plan therefore contains measures designed to control and reverse migration flows . 
obviously cooperation with third countries may help eradicate the causes of waves of refugees and migrants but this does not mean that endeavours in this direction release the union from its international obligation to protect those in need or to provide help to combat the causes of migration . 
europeans would do well to remember that the wider the prosperity gap between the member states of the union and our neighbours , the greater the pressure to migrate . 
border fortifications and repressive policing measures will not stem the tide of those seeking a share of the prosperity which we all enjoy . 
converting the union into ' fortress europe ' may put up the price charged by traffickers but , while there is no legal immigration route , it will not stop illegal entry , which is why we need to give albania all the help we can in fighting poverty , improving the standard of living and employment prospects , setting up democratic institutions and strengthening respect for human rights , especially the rights of minorities , women and children . 
there is an urgent need , following the recent attacks on the greek minority in himara , to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in albania . 
our basic objective must be to speed up the rate of economic and social development in albania and to foster its cooperation and peaceful coexistence with neighbouring countries . 
this is the only way of breaking the circle of poverty and violence which results in waves of immigrants and refugees . 
choosing a preventative policy is not in keeping with the multi - sectoral analysis which should have informed the work of the high - level working group or with the tampere conclusions , which stress the need for absolute respect for the right to seek asylum based on the application of the geneva convention . 
another problem is the integration , using specific means , of albanians legally resident in the member states . 
so bearing all these problems in mind , the proposals set out in my report include : gradual application of the measures proposed in the action plan , a study of the real needs , such as that contained in the first part , which indicates where the most urgent problems lie ; for example , first the economy and democratic institutions need to be developed and infrastructures need to be created in albania and then the union can think about signing refugee and migrant repatriation agreements . 
i particularly stress the need to take steps to improve internal security , strengthen dialogue between european officials and local authorities in albania and , as far as the commission and council are concerned , to promote specific action involving cooperation with the albanian , italian and greek authorities . 
however , we also have another problem in albania . 
a considerable number of albanians are leaving their homeland because of the instability in their country , because of the social difficulties and because of the pre - modern structures of society and family . 
mr president , the action plan states in its analysis that the status quo in albania is worrying . 
the poor social , economic and political conditions combined with a lack of or insufficient legal certainty and organised crime are causing migration on a huge scale . 
albania is a significant country of transit and origin for immigration into the european union . 
on the other hand , positive efforts are being made to drive forward the democratisation process and to develop society , which we must and will support . 
restricting the number of immigrants coming into the eu from and through albania is the main aim of the action plan . 
to achieve this , measures are needed which work in two different directions . 
firstly , the positive forces in albania need to be supported ; secondly , legal instruments need to be created for immigration from this region , which restrict or stop illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings , as well as the diverse forms of crime associated with them such as illicit employment and prostitution . 
we need preventative measures specially tailored to albania , which will provide support for building or rebuilding the country so as to enable people to live in dignity in the region . 
i welcome the action plan , but i cannot support what mrs karamanou says in her report because she does not describe the illegal crossing of borders as a criminal act and therefore says that it is legal . 
for us to tackle the causes , however , and not continue just to fight against the symptoms , we need to provide help in the regions concerned and we need to resolve the whole issue of immigration , asylum and war refugees in the european union by coming up with solutions which do justice to the immigrants but also to the host countries . 
( applause ) 
mr president , unlike mrs pack , i am of the opinion that the more groups that are involved in albania the better . 
the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs constitutes a forum in which this issue should be discussed , because these are not issues that can be resolved instantaneously , but ones that we will perhaps be confronted with for decades to come . 
it would , therefore , be valuable for the programme that we have before us , and which i feel mrs karamanou covers very well in her report , to be subdivided into measures that can be implemented swiftly , medium - term measures and those regarding a legacy of history that we have been combating for 500 years and which will persist for centuries to come . 
the legal instruments selected fall into the bracket of medium - term measures ; the issue of a group of honest customs officials and unimpeachable judges is an economic issue as well , and one that will take decades to resolve . 
recently , we have , thank heavens , seen positive signals emerging from that part of the balkans that has an indirect impact on albania . 
the hard metho. the polic. can be used when it comes to the trade in children and women and to slave labour . 
the tighter the borders we attempt to create , the more insane forms of refugee smuggling we shall see . 
clearly , there is no instant solution to be found to the entire problem , but in the slightly longer term it is a matter of creating a world of reasonable justice , of security and of opportunities for the future . 
this applies both to the albanian people and to the people of other areas who attempt , via albania , to reach the land of milk and honey represented by the european union . 
our forefathers went to the united states to create a life in freedom , as they believed . 
we are trying to stand in the way of those who are doing the same thing today . 
it is quite incredible that we have reached this point . 
let us try to see the truth with open eyes . 
we shall never be able to live in peace and freedom and with prosperity and justice if we perpetrate this appalling injustice on the very closest neighbours of the european union . 
mr president , commissioner , the greens of the efa group would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs karamanou , on her report ; which is very accurate . 
it is indeed the case that measures must be taken with regard to migration , more specifically forced migration , and that the causes must be tackled . 
i would particularly like to highlight the predicament of women and children in albania . 
first of all , it is tragic how many young people disappear , are kidnapped and leave involuntarily , or sometimes voluntarily . 
the villages are ecological disaster areas : waste is dumped everywhere , the water is not always drinkable and electricity is deficient . 
the situation was exacerbated when action by political forces lavishly supported by the european union resulted in the pyramid scandal in 1997 and robbed the people of their savings and , at the same time , shattered any confidence in the structures and organisation of the albanian state . 
this situation resulted in a popular uprising which basically abolished the albanian state , causing huge security , political and economic problems for the albanian people . 
massive quantities of arms passed into the hands of uncontrolled gangs which soon set up as mafia - type organised criminal gangs . 
i think that the time is now right to adopt and impose these measures . 
we have reached a stage where the conditions are in place and we all accept that if we do so we will be providing a huge service . 
mr president , i welcome the fact that an action plan has been drawn up for albania and i also welcome my colleague ' . mrs karamanou ' . 
committed report . on the basis of her analysis of the political and economic situation in albania , it is possible for us to reach a better understanding of the causes of the migratory movements and to develop corresponding measures . 
i do regret , however , the fact that this action plan , and also the other action plans which have been drawn up , are characterised above all by measures aimed at control and repression . 
albania is one of the poorest countries in the world and has itself taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
at present , there is a heavy stream of refugees returning which the lack of security , law and order is actually impeding . 
some of the people being sent back have integrated well . 
young people are having to interrupt their training and are facing an uncertain future . 
the toughest possible action needs to be taken against trafficking in human being. in particular in small childre. and the exploitation of people for illicit work and prostitution . 
we cannot forget nations that are in distress : our duty is to support them to the best of our ability . 
i have seen no sign of this solidarity that is supposed to bind europe , now that it has come to sharing the problems of another people . 
however , what i cannot accept in this report , and i will state this quite frankly , is that it confuses cause and effect , which is to say it confuses a procedure for the carefully considered issuing of visas , and hence the possibility of migration , with a cause , that of illegal immigration . 
things are completely the reverse , so let us not confuse cause and effect . 
above all , i find it unacceptable and negative vis - à - vis albania that we should in a sense intimate that illegal immigration could be tolerated . 
we do not have any european standards on the protection of minorities . 
you will remember the provisions recently presented to us on climbing ladders . 
i remember standards for ship survey organisation . i hope that i am not causing the interpreters problem. and i remember a proposal for a directive on ambient noise which actually intends to produce noise cards for the whole of the european union . 
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market explicitly calls on the commission to resist the legislative pressure to which it has itself objected . 
this is no excuse for doing things which are actually superfluous . 
but of course , this request is also directed at ourselves to be sparing with european regulation . 
we are helped here by the principle of subsidiarity which , in the view of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , should also be applied when deciding whether to make a particular matter the subject of internal market legislation . 
this principle should also be observed in full for green and white papers and for action programmes . 
the european union cannot claim to have a monopoly on competence here . 
here , too , specific authorisation is required , together with thorough verification of compliance with subsidiarity . 
on this occasion , we have also discussed a tendency which we find worrying , which is for more and more decisions to be taken away from the institutions which actually have the democratic legitimacy to do this . 
the introductory comments in the commission 's white paper on good governance set us thinking . 
if then a comprehensive set of networks is to be formed , if more soft law is enacted , if interpretative guidelines are adopted by the commission and if many issues are resolved by agreement between the parties concerned , then this may well all be justified , but it cannot impinge on the responsibility of the legislator . 
we ask the commission here quite specifically to observe the clear demarcation of responsibilities both between the eu and the member states and within the institutions . 
with this report we want to send out a signal to the public that we are taking their complaints about the deficient quality of lawmaking and the complaints about over - regionalisation and centralism seriously . 
i would ask you to help us to send out this signal , and to vote in favour of this report of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
mr president , may i first , on behalf of my group , congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report , which certainly gives a very good , consistent and comprehensive picture of the situation as he sees it . 
nevertheless , my group tabled a large number of amendments both in committee and in the plenary , and the fact that it did so is no reflection on the quality of the report , but because we are , after al. particularly on the issue of the scope of the principle of subsidiarit. of a different political opinion . 
we want a strong union which takes full responsibility for the tasks incumbent on it , which creates a well - functioning internal market and which actually makes it possible to strengthen social and regional cohesion . 
it has to be possible for the community to act wherever this makes it possible to achieve improved and increased european added value . 
it is particularly important for this strength of acting at community level to be emphasised at this time . 
firstly because , in view of the forthcoming enlargement , we are in especial need of a strong european union if we want to help the future new member states and their peoples , and also if we want to overcome the many crucial tests facing us in our member states . 
secondly , we in the european parliament , of all people , should be emphasising european togetherness and the community aspect , particularly at a time when we are seeing that the commitment of the governments of many member states to this is declining , and that short - sighted , egotistical nationalism and a desire to go it alone are gaining increasing ground . 
but it is precisely when we want the creative power of the community to be at work in all the central and important european issues , and when this is also accepted and supported by the public , that it is certainly necessary for us to concentrate more than ever on the essential points and to delete a good many of the points from our present agenda . 
i am also convinced , if we can agree on what is necessary and right , that it would be better to do this on a case - by - case basis and to remove anything superfluous from the agenda . 
it is certainly easier to make pragmatic decisions in individual cases than it is in general reports and debates of principle . 
this is particularly true of the principle of subsidiarity , but it also applies to the quality of legislation . 
instead of having abstract arguments about general principles , we should consider the necessity of individual projects more often in this house and we should also invest more time and resources in legislative quality . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first and foremost like to thank the rapporteur , mr wuermeling for the work he has invested in his report . 
it is of course quite a significant topic , although this is not immediately evident from the small number of members present in this chamber to continue with the debate . 
this parliament produces european legislation much like a conveyer belt . 
all too often , however , we are forced to conclude that this european legislation is packaged in a language which is too technical , too legal and too complex , so much so that this european legislation becomes unusable , as a result of which the intended goal , namely to make legislation in the european union transparent and unambiguous , is not achieved . 
european legislation must be a flexible and practical instrument which also becomes accessible to the average citizen pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity and reasonableness . 
i was delighted to note that amendments nos 3, 4, 5 and 6, which i tabled myself , have been approved by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
indeed , the objective of these amendments is to continually evaluate the subsidiarity reports , to check on a regular basis whether they are up - to - date and to investigate beforehand whether certain regulations and / or directives are indeed useful . 
i am also in favour of making codified proposals with regard to amendments to existing ec legislation , so that the amendments can be integrated into the existing directives or regulations . 
finally , i am an advocate of setting up some kind of scoreboard for redundant legislation . 
it is beyond question that redundant legislation needs to be abolished , for it is indeed not sufficient to restrict the inflation of legislation ; rules and regulations must also be drafted in clear language and the obligations pursuant to these must be easily understood . 
i therefore hope that the report will be adopted without further amendment , by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and that it will be a useful instrument to simplify european legislation and to render it transparent and effective . 
mr president , it is a great pleasure to have the opportunity of commenting on this report by mr wuermeling and on the fundamental underlying question of making our law in europe good law and clear law . 
i congratulate mr wuermeling on his report . 
law should be made close to the people , and local knowledge , whenever it is the most relevant knowledge , should always be applied , rather than the grand over - arching scheme . 
mr president , i think we should be very pleased with the quality of this report . 
our fellow citizens often see subsidiarity as a vague concept , but they can certainly appreciate its proper application . 
there are many examples where we see that a comparatively simple piece of simple market legislatio. a common standard , a single principl. has become over - complex , over - enforced at national level and has caused considerable difficulties . 
i would ask the commission to have a serious look at this problem of gold - plating . 
let us take , shall we say , six clear examples and look at how they have been transposed in detail , how they operate within the countries , how they are being enforced and make a really clear and transparent assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation , because if legislation is not effective , then we have all wasted our time . 
mr president , i should first like to recall the kind reference mr maccormick made to my intervention in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
mr maccormick state. it is , in fact , tru. that i had said that the principle of subsidiarity was not a legal principle but rather a political principle . 
having studied the report with great care , i have come to the conclusion that it is not even a political principle : it is a theological principle . 
mr maccormick , himself , has just pointed out that the principle was expressed by a pope , and it is clear that it is impregnated with theological considerations . 
nevertheless i believe we have to insist that as it is in the treaty it is a principle that can stand before the court of justice . 
it is true that we do not yet have a case based on a breach of the principle of subsidiarity , but it is there and we cannot ignore that . 
in other words , mr president , the principle of subsidiarity is probably the principle that fuses , brings together and sums up what the building of europe is all about , because ultimately it is nothing but the political will that is included in the treaty . 
an understanding of the principle of subsidiarity depends greatly on what the political will is at any moment . 
i am therefore not very enthusiastic about certain aspects of the report , because i would have liked the report to have been more ' communitising ' as regards the internal market , and on this point , especially , these are clearly not the prevailing winds in the report . 
as regards the rest , mr president , the report deals with other issues that are not on the same level . 
codification and simplification are important and laudable issues , but only a matter of good legal technique . 
i also agree with the report and views expressed in the discussion here that enlargement will present a major challenge vis - à - vis the quality of legislation , owing to the economic , social and legal problems which the new member states will bring with them . 
this must be respected and taken into consideration by eu legislators . 
subsidiarity , proportionality , better quality legislation , simple regulation , increased codification : all must become major political issues on which we will focus . 
that is the area where we must look at issues with a very open mind . 
i will take a very personal position by saying that there can be new types of governance here , where regulation and self - regulation can be complementary and not alternatives . 
this directive could be 64 pages long , extremely detailed , mathematical , and involve a lot of engineering expertise . 
since 1 january 1999, exchange rates have been irrevocably fixed . 
it is understandable that the public is disappointed about the continuing high charges , because since this time the banks have no longer been faced with exchange - related risks . 
these charges still exist , both for exchanging cash and for making cross - border payments . 
in light of the fact that we are now living in a single market with a single currency , it is unacceptable that these excessive charges should continue to exist . 
mr posselt , that was all most interesting , but it has very little to do with the way in which you voted . 
nevertheless , i did not cut you off . 
( the sitting was closed at 6.36 p.m ) . 
new eu / morocco fisheries agreement 
the next item is the oral question to the commission ( b5 - 0546 / 00 ) by mr varela suanzes - carpegna on behalf of the committee on fisheries on the state of negotiations for a new fisheries agreement with morocco . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i must begin by lamenting the fact that the commissioner for fisheries , mr fischler , cannot be here today . 
i have been talking to him in person this week in connection with a fisheries event taking place simultaneously in brussels , which we have already criticised in our committee on fisheries : a seminar on control over fisheries is being held , to which meps were invited during a week in which we also have a plenary sitting in strasbourg , the timetable for which was known a year in advance . 
this is therefore doubly serious . 
i have made this known to mr fischler and i am now repeating it publicly here . 
faced with this situation and the imminence of negotiations which might begin next monday in brussels , i do not think the commission will give us much information today , due to the fact that it will do thi. we hop. on monday 30 october . 
the logic of not unveiling her. as the commissioner himself said to m. the strategy that is to be revealed at the said negotiations , is justified and worthy of respect . 
so , as chair of the committee on fisheries , i would like to use our oral question and this debate to talk to both side. since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both side. about a few issues , and i would like to do so very calmly . 
first , i would like to emphasise the great concern of the committee on fisheries over the huge delay in negotiation. almost a year from the end of the previous agreemen. which is the reason behind our oral question , which was formulated in september . 
on the subject of the said motion for a resolution , i would like to highlight our firm support for the european commission to continue negotiating with morocco , and our call for morocco to negotiate and find the best , most beneficial solution for both parties , as this is possible and must be found . 
there is plenty of room for cooperation in the field of fisheries , and with willingness on both sides , it can , and must , be achieved . 
there need only be one yardstick for the conservation of fish stocks . 
the european union applies to its common fisheries policy the fundamental principle of responsible fishing and the conservation of resources , which are essential conditions for everyone , for the moroccans , for the europeans and for the non - europeans who fish in morocco . 
on the other hand , having said this , we also maintain that not just any agreement will suffice . 
it must be an agreement which provides an impetus for fisheries cooperation and the moroccan fishing industry , but which also fully satisfies the fisheries interests of the european fleets . 
it would be a pity for so much effort not to lead to a solution that we all want so much , or for our relations with the sovereign people of morocco to be obstructed or clouded at a time when the new young monarchy is initiating a stage of progress that inspires hope and when relations with the european union must play a decisive role in supporting such hope . 
i repeat , it would be a pity to dash so much hope for the future and so many possibilities for mutual understanding . 
we also tell the commission in section 8 what we expect from it should it be unable to reach a satisfactory agreement . 
i will end , mr president , by saying that there are many ways of reaching this agreement and there is still time , although unfortunately not much . 
this is what the people of the european union , whom we represent here , are demanding . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission has maintained a constant position throughout the contacts it has had with morocco , a position which reflects the mandate approved by the council in october 1999 . 
we agreed that the new form of cooperation thereby established must take account of the interests of both parties and we took note of the fact that morocco considered the potential spin - offs of a new partnership in terms of jobs to be an important element of our cooperation . 
the commission emphasised on behalf of the community that it was ready to provide morocco with assistance in developing its fishing industry , but that achieving this objective must not make us lose sight of european interests linked to the possibility of sustainable fishing activities in moroccan waters . 
from our standpoint , it is of vital importance that community fishermen resume their activities at a level compatible with the obligation to guarantee sustainable resources . 
mr president , commissioner , tomorrow it will be exactly a year since our last debate here in parliament on the subject of morocco . 
it is hard to believe that a whole year has gone by . 
i am tentatively expecting a fast and satisfactory outcome . 
i doubt that until now you will have heard of this problem , which is to be presented in this debate in all its harshness . 
in any case , the aid will end on 31 december , the date planned for the conversion of the fleet . 
what a beginning to the third millennium for the european union : we are converting the fleet because we have been incapable of negotiating a new fisheries agreement with morocco . 
eleven months after the expiry of the previous agreement , nobody is assuring us that we will reach an agreement before 31 december . 
what has not been achieved in eleven months will be difficult to achieve in a few days . 
mr busquin , i have sometimes , as a member of this parliament , had the feeling that the european commission , the commissioner , and in particular the director - general for fisheries were acting as if they were ashamed of the sector and even of those member states that they were called upon to represent in this negotiation . 
we are the main importers of moroccan fisheries , agricultural and industrial products . 
the fishermen in particular cannot be blamed for not understanding the situation and for being very disappointed about the fact that the negotiations concerning the morocco agreement have dragged on . 
mr president , we are debating the third agreement with morocco , which above all concerns french and portuguese fishermen , who make up the bulk of the fleet , even though a small number of french and swedish fishermen are also concerned . 
it is clear that , together with morocco , mauritania a little further to the south , and senegal , we are dealing with some of the richest fishing regions in the world . 
with the second agreement , things were very clear . 
our moroccan friends and i were in no doubt that this was going to be the final agreement . 
now we have reached the moment of truth for all concerned , first of all for morocco , which has a right to permanent sovereignty over its natural resources . 
but that is not what i heard just now , when talk was of fishing off the coast of an occupied territory , the western sahara in this case , which will be of great assistance to us during the negotiations . 
the moroccans have the right to sustainable development and to a major small - scale industry , just as they have the right to create a food industry based on their fisheries and their fish . 
on the spanish and portuguese side , i understand they are invoking a certain historic right . 
the spaniards have put forward the case of an established practice and presence , and of an economic and human problem affecting 20 000 people who work in the fisheries and supporting industries . 
i am thinking of the tree growers and the market gardeners that we have sold out and also of the interests of southern europe . 
to the spanish and portuguese members of the house , i would say that in life everything has to come to an end , even fisheries agreements with the third world . 
mr president , i think the most important thing at the moment is that for almost a year we have been starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that in three days tim. next monday - , we will know what to expect , whether the fisheries cooperation with morocco will continue and what type of cooperation this will be . 
this house has been quite rightly criticised along with the commission regarding the agreement with morocco , which from the outset has been addressed with tremendous hesitation and naivety . 
there is one point in the resolution that has been interpreted in very different ways , some of which are truly ridiculous and false and have been published in certain sectors of the media . 
i am therefore particularly keen to make it clear that if there is anything that sets the ppe - de group apart , it is not only in supporting , defending and fostering fisheries agreements , but also in firmly promoting their extension . 
however , in no way can this mean that the ppe - de group is opposed to private fisheries agreements , simply because opposing them would mean condemning half of the community fleet . 
i would very much like to know if anyone is really opposed to this solution , and how , and on what grounds , this will be explained to the fishing sector . 
i believe we are here to clear the way for the future of community fishing , not to block it . 
the two approaches are therefore completely justifiable , as both are based on the fundamental aim of conserving resources . 
we are therefore defending the responsibility that lies with us in the bilateral agreements and in private agreements , where the activity of the fleet is regulate. and will be even more so in futur. by regional fisheries organisations such as iccat , nafo and camelar . 
i have nothing more to say , mr president , except to express my hopes for the best before the meeting on the 30th . 
mr president , the absence of mr fischler , which is justified , as the chair of the committee on fisheries made clear earlier , prevents me from going into too much detail . 
however , i would like to convey a few brief messages to the commission , which is worthily represented today by commissioner busquin . 
i believe that this fact should be noted and made clear and doubts raised as to whether the commission is capable of negotiating international agreements , especially having heard president prodi request an international remit for the commission . 
we are talking about a territory that does not belong to morocco , but that is being administrated by morocco . 
if we help morocco to over - exploit this territory , which is awaiting a un - supervised referendum , if we develop a moroccan fishing fleet to exploit the fish in this territory , what will happen when this territory becomes self - governing and what will we do with the moroccan fleet ? 
thirdly , since the fisheries agreement came to an end , community and non - community fleets that are not subject to the control of either the commission or the member states have continued to exploit the saharan fishing grounds , in particular a substantial dutch fleet . 
what measures does the commission intend to take to prevent at least the community fleets from continuing to over - exploit these resources ? 
fourthly , as mrs miguélez emphasised , when the previous fisheries agreements were signed , the european union made significant concessions to morocco on all points . 
last year , morocco withdrew from the negotiating table and , like a good player who has won , ended up with all the cards and did not forfeit a single concession . 
my question to the commission is this : if an agreement is not reached with morocco , or if this agreement is concluded under the terms indicated by the commission , an agreement that stimulates moroccan production , is the commission planning to adopt structural measures to compensate for the losses that will occur in the regions affected . 
mr president , i rise to speak in order to express our support for a resolution with which my group and i , as member for galicia , agree . 
i nevertheless hope , of course , that i am mistaken and that the treaty will finally be signed without further delay . 
in future , we will have to learn to live without fishing concessions bequeathed to us by our colonial past . 
mr president , commissioner , the european union has had fishing agreements with morocco since 1992 . 
the agreement currently in force expired at the end of november last year . 
under this agreement , around 500 boats from the european union , 50 of which are portuguese , have had access to moroccan waters at an annual cost of around eur 125 million . 
lastly , in the undesirable event that negotiations should fail , the union has a political and moral duty to support the fishermen and shipowners with a reasonable amount of aid that will ensure that they have the means to live . 
that is the minimum requirement , but by itself it is not enough . 
the union must prepare a programme for conversion of activities carried out by the operators affected , in order to give them a stable future . 
we have to resolve the overcapacity situation in the eu fisheries industry . 
let people fish with eu money in eu waters only ! 
this saying aptly describes relations between numerous neighbouring countries . 
historically , it is neighbours that seem to have so much trouble with each other and the idea of the european union is to resolve problematic relations with neighbours . 
i should like here to take my hat off to spanish foreign policy . 
it reminded me of scenes from our history and from my childhood , when konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle drove through german towns in exactly the same way , demonstrating that the problems between the two neighbours had been overcome and that france and germany would together form the core of european integration . 
spain and morocco have a similar opportunity to become the core of integration in the mediterranean . 
i think that spain and morocco have done a great deal in order to avoid what many see as unavoidable , namely the clash of civilisations , the conflict when different cultures collide . 
spain has developed a marvellous bridging function here , as has portugal , and i think that we should look at this fisheries agreement in this light . 
the spanish and portuguese fishermen deserve our undivided support . 
i would remind the honourable member that the order of business allows one minute 's speaking time and that applies to all honourable members . 
the committee on legal affairs has formulated a clear position here and thrown its weight behind the union citizens whose rights have been restricted . 
i consider this action to be dubious . 
if we take the view that these practices are legally acceptable and politically desirable then , as legislators , we should go ahead and change the principles , but if this is an attempt to use parliament to conceal a position , then all i have to say is that the ppe wants no part of it ! 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the case of non - italian foreign language assistants in italian universities is well known in the commission and in most european institutions . 
this affair has been ongoing for more than a decade and , as a result of intervention on the part of the european institutions , in particular the commission , the situation of the assistants has improved . 
as you know , the issue is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 italian universities . 
as regards the language assistants ' subsequent claims concerning their acquired rights , the commission launched another infringement procedure on the grounds that , in a certain number of italian universities , the assistants ' acquired rights were not being duly safeguarded . 
in fact , the commission mobilised a lot of its resources in order to examine this case . 
in fact , the services of the commission put together hundreds of pages of documentation on specific cases in a number of universities . 
it is our view that freedom of movement enables european citizens not to be the victims of discrimination under national systems of law . 
it does not give them the right to a special legal status . 
each member state is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service . 
i fully appreciate the commission 's position and , indeed , as parliament , we must be very careful . 
i am not defending my government out of solidarit. it is not my government , i belong to an opposition part. but i am trying to clarify the matter . 
we make every endeavour to ensure that the citizens enjoy the same rights in all the states , but they also have to respect and face up to the same responsibilities in all the states . 
it is intolerable for european citizens to have some sort of privileged access in a state other than their own and not to have to undergo the same tests and bear the same burdens as the citizens of that country , in the case in the point the citizens of italy . 
in the european union , education and teaching is structured according to the principle of subsidiarity , with the result that the laws of the member states differ . 
until they get the same as their equivalents in italy this matter will rumble on . 
i listened carefully to what mr busquin said on behalf of the commission . 
some people say there is a whiff of hypocrisy from the commission . 
some even go further and say there is a stench of hypocrisy from the commission . 
i will go as far so to say there is a small smell of hypocrisy coming from the commission . 
if the commission were truly serious about resolving this issue it would have been resolved years ago . 
we can perhaps accept that the previous commission under mr santer was not the best , so that is why it went . 
but i have to say we are looking at this commission : the president of this commission is fully aware of this case , is fully aware of the facts , and yet nothing has been done to resolve it . 
we have to ask why . 
that is why this parliament today is again debating this issue , highlighting this issue , to put it back before the commission and say : get this sorted out . 
mr president , politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance , or how strong its moral base , there is no legal remedy . 
if in this parliament we genuinely believe in a citizen 's europe , we must strive to secure one . 
as has been said , this is the third time that this issue has come before parliament in the form of a motion for a resolution . 
i hope and trust that there will be no need for it ever to do so again , unless it is to thank all those involved for the fact that effective action has now been taken . 
we are a small house because it is a friday morning but it needs to be noticed and recognised that this is an all - party issue and an all - union issue . 
members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market from all over the union and from all the parties have come together to say that it is no use talking about rights , advocating charters of rights if you do not , in real cases when people 's rights are denied , take effective action to get them recognised and to get them enforced , and that is the problem in this case . 
i was sorry to see , for example , one of the amendments taking out the reference not only to an appeal to the ombudsman but the fact that the ombudsman answered it affirmatively . 
that is a critical point because the ombudsman said that the commission acted wrongly in failing to communicate with the language lettori the fact that they were changing pleadings on an important and significant article , and the article on which the commission changed its pleadings is the very point that commissioner busquin mentioned . 
the point is that the lettori claim the right to continue as teachers , not to be changed into something else . 
nobody disputes that the italian republic is fully within its entitlement , in 1995 or at any other time , to say for the future we will not hire people as lettori , we will bring in people for a new kind of appointment . 
shamefully , in this very house the left - wing and liberal groups have conspired to block the two princes ' access to the court of justice although a ruling is expected shortly from the court of human rights in strasbourg . 
governments must understand that if they sign treaties then they must either abrogate them as sovereign states or abide by their terms in a rule of law . 
the italian government , which comprises left - wing parties who constantly extol the virtues of european laws , rights and treaties , must act soon on both these issues if its commitments to the values for which it claims to stand are not to generate widespread cynicism in other member states about italy 's commitment to uphold european law . 
so far the european commission has proven unwilling to enforce the treaties when the number of people affected are few . 
in the instance of my motion on the royal family this was even described by the liberal rapporteur in this house on human rights as an exotic motion of no interest . 
well , i believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with european law , particularly the freedom of movement , and no exceptions can be made to these principles . 
there must be non - discrimination for eu citizens wherever they come from and wherever they want to go to within the union . 
obviously education still comes under subsidiarity but , within the framework of the treaties , the freedom of movement of workers and the ban on discrimination apply to everyone , although w. and i in particular , coming as i do from a highly federalist stat. support the principle of subsidiarity as a principle of order in our dealings with the european union and do what we can so that powers are divided as quickly as possible between the levels in europe in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity . 
italy 's conduct in this matter runs counter to the objectives of the community and runs counter to our desire to increase the mobility and flexibility of workers . 
the diversity of cultures , which we see as a fundamental element of europe , finds expression first and foremost in the diversity of languages . 
anyone who stands up for the diversity of cultures must do what they can so that we can maintain the diversity of languages and learn them everywhere . 
coming from a country whose active population is more than 50 % non - luxembourgeois , foreign residents or people who cross the border every day to work , i know what i am talking about . 
in my country , for secondary school teachers we have very strict and very hard recruitment competitions . 
we cannot , and i say this as a matter of principle , discriminate against nationals by making access to employment easier for non - nationals . 
we are supposed to have mutual recognition of qualifications across europe so that you can qualify in your own country and then move to others . 
that is a basic issue in mr busquin 's response which needs to be questioned and i am sorry to see that he has now left the chamber . 
madam president , i should like to thank you very much for extending your sympathies and condolences on the occasion of this terrible tragedy which we have just experienced . 
many of these mainly young people boarded the train with the prospect of enjoying themselves , having fun and experiencing something positive , and they instead experienced a terrible and tragic death . 
madam president , may i take this opportunity , since you addressed this matter in such clear and sympathetic terms , to say that for this reason we can dispense with having a topical and urgent debate on this matter . 
i would ask you to understand that for this reason we do not really need to have the topical and urgent debate . 
madam president , allow me to thank you very much on behalf of my delegation for your message of sympathy which you sent on behalf of the european parliament following the catastrophe at kitzsteinhorn to our president , dr klestil , our chancellor , wolfgang schüssel , and thus to all the people of austria . 
thank you also for having the flags flown at half - mast . 
we are united in shock and grief for the 150 people who died and we share in the pain of their relatives . 
we extend our deepest sympathies to them . 
the great austrian poet , rainer maria rilke , once wrote that death is great and that we find ourselves in its laughing mouth . 
the burning inferno on the funicular railwa. a railway which was considered to be one of the safes. which leads to one of the most beautiful areas of the austrian alps , makes everything else fade into the background , and the readiness to share pain and grief becomes our only comfort . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
the minutes of the sitting of friday 27 october have been distributed . 
are there any comments ? 
madam president , our minutes of the 27 october record our decision to pass a resolution about the italian lettori and we were very grateful that the house carried it with such a large majority . 
in the meantime , members of the house should know that the president of the association of the lettori was last week visited in his classroom by the anti - terrorist police to check if he was planning any violent demonstration against the minister of education . 
does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral to committee ? 
madam president , the report drafted by my colleague , mr ceyhun , is a very important one , and we , too , have heard that the council has some new plans with regard to these matters . 
you are , thus , firmly in favour of the referral to committee . 
does anyone wish to speak against this request ? 
madam president , it appears that the council has known for some time that we were going to debate this subject today . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , our group regards this incident as being so important that we do not consider it appropriate for it to be dealt with in the topical and urgent debate . 
we think that we should address this matter in the form of an oral question to the council and the commission , and would like to draft this carefully to ensure that both the council and the commission do discuss it . 
we do not think that the time is right to discuss this matter in a topical and urgent debate and would therefore request that this item be deleted from the agenda . 
thank you , mr poettering . 
does anyone else wish to speak in favour of this request ? 
i would like to tell you and all my colleagues that this statement is being marketed in a way that makes it appear favourably disposed towards birds , as promoting their welfare , but i can tell you that that is not the case , and that this will worsen the situation of migratory birds in the european union . 
i feel that the commission has been very receptive to your request , as commissioner vitorino has confirmed to me . 
it will therefore be acted upon appropriately . 
on the one hand , a representative of the pensioners ' party might welcome the presence of invalid. another pensioner perhap. but , on the other , i would like all our members to be safe . 
i therefore ask you when a lift or an escalator will be installed , so that we will be able to go down to the cars at the end of the day in safety . 
madam president , i would like to inform parliament of a serious initiative undertaken last week in italy by the regional government of the lazio region . 
the fact is that these texts merely present the history of italy , of the second world war , of nazism and fascism , on the assumption that it is clear that the values for which the resistance and the antifascists were fighting and the ideas motivating hitler and mussolini cannot be regarded as equal . 
this is an extremely serious initiative towards reintroducing censorship in italy , limited to text books for the moment but which will soon be extended to other areas . 
since the allegedly liberal parties , including the european liberal parties , always tend to ally themselves with parties of xenophobic , racist , authoritarian inspiration , i feel that this is not only a serious danger for italy , but also an indication of something which concerns the whole of europe . 
i would ask the members to sign a petition which i am circulating , which also bears the signatures of other european intellectuals . 
mutual assistance in criminal matters 
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports : 
( a5 - 0313 / 2000 ) by mr marinho , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the initiative of the french republic with a view to adopting a council framework decision on money laundering , the identification , tracing , freezing , seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime [ 10232 / 200 . 
c5 - 0393 / 200 . 
2000 / 0814 ( cns ) ] , 
( a5 - 0312 / 2000 ) by mrs karamanou , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the initiative from the portuguese republic with a view to adopting a council act on the drawing up on the basis of article 43 ( 1 ) of the convention on the establishment of a european police office ( europol convention ) of a protocol amending article 2 and the annex to that convention [ 9426 / 200 . 
c5 - 0359 / 200 . 
considering that money laundering is at the heart of organised crime , especially drug trafficking , which represents such a threat to public health and public security , one cannot but endorse this proposed measure . 
declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace , freeze , seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime . 
this proposed protocol should be seen as a necessary measure in a european strategy for police cooperation in the field of money laundering . 
the creation of a european area of freedom , security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments . 
this is a major area of european integration and the european parliament is ready to offer its support to policies in this area provided it is duly involved . 
madam president , international criminal networks have become considerably stronger and more organised in recent years . 
factors such as globalisation can be seen to have enhanced the possibilities of laundering dirty money and the means of avoiding prosecution . 
according to figures released by the united nations , 1 000 billion dollars are recycled every year through money laundering operations . 
money laundering is a difficult offence to detect , and crime syndicates take advantage of every loophole in the various legal systems . 
as a result , international cooperation in police and judicial matters is the only way of effectively thwarting this illegal practice . 
in the more specific area of combating money laundering , we could cite the council directive of 10 june 1991, as recently amended , for which our fellow mep , mr lehne , acted as rapporteur . 
the initiative from the french presidency that we are examining today is aimed at improving the two blanket conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters that i have just mentioned , specifically in the field of combating money laundering . 
the convention that we have before us improves these earlier texts , and we welcome these improvements . 
by virtue of article 2 of the draft convention , the member states can no longer decline to conduct searches or seize items by invoking the reservations set out in article 5 of the convention of 1959 . 
the protection of fundamental rights must be guaranteed in this regard . 
as i have said , that is why i support the proposals on the table today but , at the same time , i would take this opportunity to give you advance notice that there will be a real battle with the council over the common position on the second directive to combat money laundering . 
allow me to start by congratulating mr marinho on his work and to say that , although we need to support efforts to combat financial crime , we also need to be careful . 
the problem of financial crime is extremely complex : first it is a convoluted attempt to launder the proceeds of illegal activity and , secondly , it presupposes a series of other crimes which generated the illegal proceeds in the first place . 
this phrase troubled me greatly because i think it is the key to the problem . 
and i thin. and i too fervently propos. that we need to take a great many steps , a great many fundamental steps , if we are to achieve judicial cooperation at european level and be able to fight crimes such as financial crime . 
ladies and gentlemen , judicial and police cooperation is one of the most fundamental issues in the construction of a european area of freedom , security and justice and will enable this area to swiftly become real and effective for the citizens . 
in dealing with these matters , our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the protocol amending the europol convention and on improving mutual assistance . 
we can but congratulate them on their work . 
mr president , allow me to start by congratulating our rapporteur , mr marinho . 
i think that his analysis is extremely accurate and shows us how we really can make headway in combating the laundering of what we call ' black ' or ' dirty ' money . 
i would remind the house that we aim to use this policy to fight organised crime , i.e. drug smuggling , trafficking in women and children and many other wretched activities which have a terrible impact on society as a whole , eve. and i say this somewhat cynicall. the economy itself , in that it is generally acknowledged that this money increases the money supply and often destabilises monetary policy . 
political unification , political control may be what we need to resolve these questions and , by extension , the reviews and harmonisation of the laws governing these issues . 
these are issues which require institutional changes which , unfortunately , not even nice will make . 
i welcome this debate . 
the proceeds of crime act , which my government introduced in ireland , has been successfully utilised by our criminal assets bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activities from enjoying the fruits of their crime . 
by the end of last year , the bureau had obtained orders and property to the value of eur 20 million under the act and had made tax demands of more than eur 40 million . 
while cooperation is growing between the eu member states and our law enforcement agencies , the scale of money laundering and fraud is so vast that we are still only tinkering with the problem . 
one thousand billion dollars is the estimated annual volume of capital recycled by money laundering operations involving financial arrangements . 
these funds could be used in our towns and for other social purposes . 
i welcome this debate and discussion . 
i want to speak about the karamanou report on europol . 
everybody who has spoken agrees that it is a very valuable initiative and we support what it says . 
however , as many speakers have said , there is not enough democratic control and accountability . 
and we want the court to be involved in disputes . 
these things are in the amendments and , judging by the debate in the committee , i am very hopeful that parliament will vote for them . 
however , i want to look for just a few moments at the future , and at what comes beyond this proposal . 
i see two signs , one good and one bad . 
the bad development in the future which many colleagues have spoken abou. including my friend , mr andrew. is the remorseless growth in organised crime which we are seeing across europe . 
the opening of frontiers for the single market was a thoroughly good idea but it has also helped the mafia , and criminals from eastern europe to spread their tentacles across our union . 
the public is in favour an. as very often happen. is ahead of us and the council of ministers . 
we must ensure that as we move towards mutual recognition of judgments we are establishing in europe the highest common standard , not the lowest common denominator , when it comes to protecting persons brought into the justice system . 
as a member of this house , i have had cases brought to my attention . 
one example is a person on a money laundering charge , held for 364 days in custody in portugal without any charge being presented . 
when finally it was presented it was in many pages of portuguese , with an insufficient english summary translation , even though the person concerned knew no portuguese . 
i have come across cases in france of lorry drivers , held on suspicion of drug traffickin. a shocking crime if it has been committed , but these persons are held in unacceptable conditions with no effective right to a defence of their own choosing , with inadequate or no interpretation facilities , with no opportunity to prove their innocence by due process of law in a reasonable time . 
while we live in a europe in which such blots exist on our escutcheons we need to be extremely careful that the steps we are taking for good do not end up destroying civil liberty in some of its most fundamental aspects in europe . 
you are incapable of taking genuine measures to prevent money laundering because to do so would entail laying the blame at the door of banking and financial groups , since they are the ones who are able to launder this money by cloaking themselves in banking secrecy . 
however , we must not forget to provide europol with sufficient staff and funding so that it is actually able to assume the responsibilities which we are assigning it . 
i should also like to take this opportunity to cal. as colleagues have done before m. for a serious anomaly finally to be removed and europol to be subject to the same supervision as other institutions of the european union . 
the second measure , the second instrument , is harmonisation . 
it only makes sense for europol to have the relevant powers if we also succeed in harmonising the substantive and formal provisions of criminal law , in terms of what constitutes a criminal offence , the severity of the penalty and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime . 
the third point is a fundamental one , namely that it is also important to improve mutual assistance in legal matters . 
mrs palacio made clear reference to this point , saying how necessary it was to also involve the relevant occupational groups and to make it clear to the member states that here european interests need to come before national interests . 
my last poin. and i think that this is also relevan. is the establishment of eurojust or the provisional unit , because this is about improving coordination on investigations and prosecutions . 
the european union and we , the european parliament , are seizing a new opportunity in the fight against organised crime , which preoccupies us to such an extent . 
the union is thus laying a building block in the transition from an economic union to a security union . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the development of the economy and the phenomenon of globalisation have been accompanied in recent years with an increase in international crime . 
according to the united nations , the annual volume of money recycled through money - laundering operations is approaching usd 1 billion . 
in the european union , we must continue to fight resolutely against money laundering , in the knowledge that , particularly after the creation of the single market and the liberalisation of the capital and financial services markets , there needs to be effective police and judicial cooperation between member states which is as efficient as possible . 
today we are discussing three reports that acknowledge the fact that money laundering lies at the root of organised crime and must therefore be eradicated , wherever it may take place . 
this is where member states , through police and judicial cooperation , can act most effectively to combat organised crime . 
this was the political will expressed by the heads of state and government at the tampere european council , in october 1999, when they called for specific action to fight money laundering . 
this was also the subject of the joint justice and internal affairs / ecofin council meeting held on 17 october . 
the karamanou report , on which i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur , proposes various amendments with regard to improving the democratic and judicial control of europol . 
you all know how important i consider the issue of such control to be . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
provisional judicial cooperation unit 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0317 / 2000 ) by mrs gebhardt , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on an initiative of the portuguese republic , the french republic , the kingdom of sweden and the kingdom of belgium with a view to adopting a council decision setting up a provisional judicial cooperation unit [ 10356 / 200 . 
c5 - 0395 / 200 . 
2000 / 0816 ( cns ) ] 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , part of the price of freedom is that the democratic state under the rule of law frequently chases wrongdoers from quite some distance when it wishes to prosecute them . 
this is especially true of serious , very serious and cross - border crimes . 
organised crime is particularly difficult to bring under control because the odds are stacked unevenly . 
the public can demand this ; above all it expects it in an increasingly homogeneous area of law and freedom , which also offers them protection and security for their material property . 
a step in the right direction , for which the european parliament has been striving for a long time now , is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation . 
in my opinion , the adjective ' provisional ' should disappear as soon as possible and make way for eurojust as an effective european prosecution body . 
the german justice minister initiated this ; it was at her suggestion that the tampere summit decided to establish eurojust over a year ago . 
ladies and gentlemen , although the need for a future european public prosecution service would not seem to pose a problem in the long run , that of harmonising our policies on the protection of citizens ' rights and establishing a criminal procedure par excellence would seem to be more than essential . 
indeed , how can one possibly set up a european public prosecution service when there is not even a european civil code or , what is more , a european criminal code ? 
two things must be borne in mind : we cannot contemplate any tangible improvement in judicial cooperation between the member states without this clearly being conditional on the protection of the rights of the defence in legal proceedings involving more than one state . 
this is the aim of our amendments . 
it follows that citizens ' rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the court of justice , not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not . 
moreover , the flaws in the new efforts to combat organised crime can be attributed to the division of competences between europol and eurojust , and these have not been clearly addressed in any case or at any point . 
for instance , in ireland and the uk our criminal code is based on the common law system whereas it is the old roman law or civil law code in most other european countries . 
there are huge differences there which are exemplified on a daily basis in europol and interpol where there is a lack of certainty and difficulties between the member state police forces with regard to what can be done and what can be achieved . 
there are also worries within member states as i know from an irish point of view : i have dealt with sixteen cases of people who have been detained in spain . 
we could not get any action from europol or from interpol operators in that country and there was a lack of understanding of the necessity for somebody to be brought to trial as quickly as possible . 
only when the institutional model and the rules governing the european area of justice are clearly defined will it be possible for citizens and parliament to express their opinions on the individual measures proposed by the council . 
unless a course is set towards a specific objective which is clear for all , in our opinion , the union is destined to go adrift both institutionally and democratically . 
setting up the provisional unit is only a first step . 
the rapporteur appreciates that setting up the second stage eurojust ought to be that much easier in the light of the experience gained , which is a view i share . 
moving subsequently towards setting up a european public prosecution authority is another question to discuss . 
in view of the subsidiarity principle , i am therefore opposed to a common catalogue of criminal law and to the eu as a common judicial body in all criminal la. if anyone should happen to see any such development as being of topical relevance right now . 
what parliament has to adopt a position on today is vigorous judicial cooperation for the purpose of combating serious organised crime . 
this is a positive development , and it is therefore gratifying that there should be so much support for it in parliament . 
i am particularly pleased about the initiative to strengthen the protection of personal data . 
i would congratulate mrs gebhardt on a good piece of work . 
i want to conclude by pointing out something i think we ought not to forget . 
without a certain degree of cooperation , it is simply not possible for us to uphold a law - governed society in an eu with freedom of movement . 
if we wish to see crime combated more efficiently , then we must also strengthen the protection of human rights , something which must be founded upon our common legal principles . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mrs gebhardt deserves our congratulations on the excellent report she has presented , dealing with one of the decisions taken at the tampere council . 
what the tampere summit required us to do was to adopt , with a view to combating cross - border crime , transnational rules in areas where it is recognised that the transnationality , or if you like the supranationality , of legal instruments constitutes added value in terms of combating illegal and criminal acts that are supranational by nature . 
criminals must be left in no doubt as to this supranationality . 
that is why when we were asked at tampere for common rules in the field of indictment and penalties for crimes against the environment , drug trafficking , trafficking in human beings , child pornography , terrorism or internet crime , it was because it was recognised that these were types of supranational criminal activities which had to be dealt with using supranational instruments . 
in this area we can indeed talk of a european public prosecutor . 
but as concerns eurojust , this is a network for coordinating the actions of national judges and public prosecutors with the objective of enhancing capabilities for combating types of serious crime at european level . 
and this is why i also see in this an important tool for ensuring judicial control of europol . 
that means that investigations and criminal proceedings that can count on the involvement of europol must be flanked and followed up by eurojust , acting as a network of judges and public prosecutors at european level . 
it is for this reason that the mutual relationships between eurojust , europol and olaf , in its role as a specialist body for combating fraud , and the existing european judicial network must be clearly defined . 
all sides gave their honest opinion. in my vie. without falling back on inflexible opposing positions . 
i observed a constructive atmosphere with the transparency and flexibility which is so often called for , and in no sense was it reminiscent of two armoured tortoises facing each other without saying a word . 
i believe that it is certainly possible to speak of a new culture of cooperation which was put into practice here for the first time . 
my question to the commission in this regard highlighted some possibilities , but unfortunately no usable result has yet emerged . 
we welcome the fact that there is a change in the policy under the new programme , moving from giving the money into the care of the policy - making directorate - general to giving it to people who are engaged in research . 
we can expect a more constructive approach to research when it is done by people interested in research rather than by people who administer the policies , as in the case of agriculture . 
generally speaking , we thank the rapporteur for drawing attention to the problems involved and look forward to the re - organised programme being more effective and more satisfactory . 
mr president , i welcome this report by mrs langenhagen , the contents of which i am very happy to endorse . 
we hope that as a result of the reform of the commission currently taking place we will see a huge correction of this in future . 
that we do not have clear targets , that we cannot measure output , is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution . 
this is very old hat . 
we know the change is coming , but we want to see it very quickly . 
it is vital that the commission follows that and gets its money back . 
mr president , i should very much like to congratulate mrs langenhagen on her report . 
i think that , in every way , mrs langenhagen has provided a clear description of the very major problems there have been in putting the fair programmes into effect and , at the same time , in also checking up on how the programmes were operating . 
in that connection , i should like to make it clear that , in view of the very great degree of expertise possessed by the commission , we cannot accept that so many of the things we adopted in the decisions have not been implemented . 
on behalf of the committee on fisheries , i should like to call attention to a fairly small number of points . 
commissioner , in the near futur. and then also with the work of the new commission in min. we will have to deal with further court of auditors ' reports or audit reports , such as the one on the joint research centre , which has turned out to be very critical , but also the special audit report on a very unusual contract with a consultancy firm . 
i hope that we will then also see a desire to actually make improvements in the areas mentioned by mrs langenhagen . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for the importance that you have attached to the court of auditors ' special report on the fair programme . 
i would particularly like to thank mrs langenhagen for her very constructive report , along with the members of the committee on budgetary control , and of the committee on fisheries and notably the rapporteur , mr busk . 
as you have also said , the fair programme formed part of the fourth framework programme . 
next , to ensure smooth coordination , a management group has been set up to ensure better coordination between the implementation of research programmes and the relevant directorates - general with responsibility for other policies . 
thirdly , the commission has adopted a common procedure for the evaluation of research proposals applicable to all the specific programmes , which can be consulted by the public in the common manual of evaluation procedures . 
a common , transparent database of experts has been established to evaluate proposals and special efforts have been made to ensure the independence of experts in respect of the evaluation of proposals . 
a common research database has been established . 
the new type of research contract now sets out in detail all the financial and administrative considerations , with more clearly - defined responsibilities for participants and a better - documented negotiation procedure . 
the commission has also significantly increased the number of audits conducted , with this number rising by 25 % annually over recent years . 
these are the measures that have been envisaged under the fifth framework programme and which are to be implemented . 
like the commission , parliament is of the opinion that joint responsibility for the implementation of the projects is closely akin to a joint financial responsibility . 
i would nevertheless like to stress one thing , which is that joint financial responsibility cannot , in a strict sense , be envisaged within the context of the framework programme , the aim of which is to set up consortia composed of various bodies , universities , smes , large companies , and public or private research institutes . 
these entities will not be able to take adequate financial precautions from among their own ranks , and in the case of the smes cannot necessarily be held liable for the insolvency of other members of the consortium . 
it is clear that this consortium approach does not establish a duality in terms of joint financial responsibility . 
this is a complex matter and one of the issues for which we must clearly find a way of ensuring greater security , but we must avoid this resulting in the exclusion from the framework programme of smes and public institutions who are fearful of having to accept responsibilities that they are unable to assume . 
we thus need not only to strike the right balance in terms of joint financial responsibility but also , furthermore , to avoid scaring off potential partners in a consortium , the only participants in which will therefore be established bodies , when what we want is to foster the participation of small and medium - sized businesses . 
on the other hand , i share your views entirely on the need to minimise the risk of double financing . 
the process is therefore under way , but we are now entering the domain of member state jurisdiction and cannot always dictate how long things will take . 
i would nevertheless stress that the three files that i have just mentioned represent 92 % of the total amount . 
these are the answers to your questions . 
there are still some new applications to put into practice , and i would like to take this opportunity to outline the guidelines on community research that we would like to develop for the next framework programme , and which the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy has already examined , since i sent a policy paper to this parliamentary committee on 4 october , and it is to draw up a report . 
there are several factors in these broad guidelines that will make for a considerable lightening of bureaucratic burdens : the switch from a project - based approach to a programme - based approach , the setting of minimum sizes for projects , the externalisation of a number of activities , such as exploratory premiums for small and medium - sized enterprises , mobility grants and , in general terms , a simplification of these procedures . 
substantial changes must also be introduced into the next framework programme . 
we will see what the impact of the modifications made to the fifth framework programme has been and i would like to thank you for showing such commitment to improvement . 
the commission shares this commitment , and i would like to hope that we can work in the best possible atmosphere to carry through this research programme , which is essential at european level , but which must be implemented in conformity with the most stringent of rules on efficiency and on financial control . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
( the sitting was closed at 8.00 p.m ) . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
are there any comments ? 
thank you , mr aparicio sánchez . 
madam president , some of us expected an announcement from the chair yesterday about the sakharov priz. to whom it had been awarded , what the voting figures were and when it would be presented in plenary . 
it must be made clear that the charter is to be regarded as morally binding . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the charter of fundamental rights , which is a key stage in the construction of europe , has given rise to much discussion . 
some think it a success and others now think it a thwarted ambition . 
everything conspired to strengthen this hope : the formation of the convention which established a new precedent in relation to the usual intergovernmental method , the public debates and the full set of texts available on an internet site that was accessible to everyone , as well as the fact that the opinion of civil society was consulted . 
transparency was no substitute , however , for the democratic deficit , as the ngos were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration . 
so , yes , some progress was made , but not enough to compensate for the omissions . 
first , because it secures the rights of our citizens vis - à - vis the institutions and bodies of the european union . 
secondly , because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the union . 
thirdly , because the charter also ensures that the current level of protection in the european human rights convention also applies in the union ; in fact , at some points , it goes even further than the european human rights convention . 
fourthly , because the charte. and this is particularly important for m. is based on indivisible civil and political human rights and fundamental social rights . 
as a member of the convention , i argued for even further - reaching social rights , especially for the right to work and to a minimum , subsistence - level income to be enshrined in the charter which , given the current social charter , it should have been . 
nonetheless , i share the overall appraisal of the european trade union confederation that , despite the narrow interpretation of social rights , the charter of fundamental rights is an important step on the road towards a social europe and a citizens ' europe and is a decided improvement over the present situation . 
madam president , i think that what we need now , especially in the run up to nice , is a comprehensive public debate with our citizens on the text of the charter ; we must also consider how to give them the opportunity to agree to this charter . 
i personally am in favour of a european referendum on the charter , as this would enable the very citizens of europe to give us democratic authorisation to press ahead and build up europe . 
madam president , great importance is often attached to the signing of charters , and this often assumes legendary status . 
such was the case with the charter of fundamental social rights of workers , signed in strasbourg during a european council , which appeared to have discharged the institutions ' undertaking to resolve the issues related to the protection of workers ' dignity . 
in fact , if it were possible to amend the charter , if it were admitted that the charter does not provide for duties and does not provide fully for rights , things would be easier : the charter does not go far enough in protecting the natural family or safeguarding children ; it disregards the need for rules to regulate every new global information technology ; it discriminates between private and public education ; with regard to safeguarding the environment , it disregards the protection of health and animal rights ; it is too general with regard to consumer protection and leaves the door open to the marketing of extremely harmful foodstuffs . 
in addition , there are political gaps in the charter such as the fact that it does not tackle the issue of political refugees . 
therefore , we feel that the charter is only important as a position of principle , as a starting point for a debate : a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop , which must take place alongside the unification process . 
we will assign to this charter the value of a political declaration , committing ourselves together : we will therefore vote for the recommendation and the alleanza nazionale will enter into a democratic debate that will supplement and finalise the content of the charter over the coming months , and which will evolve alongside the accession process and the new european citizenship . 
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe this charter is nothing more than the umpteenth example of the ability of the european union and its member states to proliferate empty texts and declarations of intent . 
until now , it existed only in the form of an anthem , a passport , but now , i feel that with this charter , it also will have some substance , the definition of rights as they are stated in this fine text . 
it is a fine text because it is readable , clear , precise and framed with an eye to the futur. well , we shall see , but in the meantime , as of right now , it is possible to read it as if it were a legal text , and that is what we sought to achieve . 
as far as parliament is concerned , the phase we are about to enter is the outcome of a long struggle , one we undertook as early as 1975 and which has been continually highlighted through our resolutions , our spinelli draft treaties , our draft european constitutions . 
i am also very proud to see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country , gunnar jansson , played a very important role when this charter was drawn up . 
i believe he has contributed to the clarity to which mrs berès referred in this chamber . 
the charter is clear and concise and could be a model for many other constitutions . 
i want to add my congratulations and thanks to mr méndez de vigo and all those who worked on it . 
i not only thank them but envy them . 
an extraordinarily fine job has been done . 
we have a text here which states concisely what europe is about and states what rights we uphold as citizens of this great union . 
i am sad , indeed , to see the ranks of british conservatives have lined up against the idea of making the institutions of the union answerable to breaches of the rights of the citizens of the union . 
it is a sad thing that the party of churchill and maxwell fyfe should have come to this point that , when we at last try to ensure that the institutions of the union are not the tyrants of brussels but persons subject under article 51 to the obligations binding on all institutions of the union , the british conservatives say " no " . 
i am not sure yet , because i have not heard from them , how far mr blair 's hounds will be let free from the leash to speak out for this brilliant project . 
i hope that mr martin , who did such a fine job in helping at this convention , will be persuading his colleagues that the time has come not merely to adopt this charter but to make it part of our law , binding upon those who govern us , not merely a proclamation but a binding part of the treaties . 
perhaps the best we can do for the time being is get it mentioned in article 6 but that will only be for starters . 
let us not merely adopt these rights but make them real in the hearts and in the experience of our citizens and let us make them part of our law . 
madam president , i do not underestimate the very important ambition of establishing a community of humanitarian values or the fact that civil , political and social rights have been placed on a par for the first time in this type of text . 
i also see the method instigated with the convention as innovatory with regard to ensuring greater information and greater transparency . 
despite all that , however , there is a major source of dissatisfaction . 
there is a significant gap between our initial ambitions and what we have actually achieved . 
it is , of course , possible to highlight this or that article , to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights . 
it is also possible to pinpoint articles which fall a long way short of the rights acknowledged elsewhere , particular in social issues . 
we should not be drawing up lists of advantages and disadvantages , madam president . 
a mistake ! 
because , at the very least , if this text is in fact adopted as it stand. and that is a crucial condition , to which i shall retur. it will become binding , by virtue of the court of justice case law . 
there are two aspects in this process which i find fascinating . 
firstly , the charter adopted in this way would take us directly to the sort of standardised europe which the overwhelming majority of members of this house claim to abhor and which the voters do not want at all . 
however , that does not change the fact that i am unable to join in the predominantly euphoric appraisal of the convention as an instrument of future constitutional development . 
apart from the substantive problems already raised today , merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in - depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments . 
i would also advise the house not to misconstrue the instrument of the convention as a deus ex machina of the european union . 
just one last word to the president - in - office : as a former member of a supreme court , i can assure you that if the jurisdiction of various supreme courts overlaps , this will quickly give rise to diverging case law and diverging case law is only to be expected . 
we must not , under any circumstances , lose sight of this problem . 
the charter of fundamental rights has always been a priority for this parliament , because it has wanted the principles and values that unite europeans to be reflected in a text . 
this is particularly important at the present time , when we are beginning an ambitious process of enlargement . 
the second reason is because the charter of fundamental rights is an essential factor in the move towards political union . 
thirdly , mr president , and surely this is the most important reason , because a charter of fundamental rights is going to increase the feeling of belonging to the european union . 
for all these reasons , my group , as its chairman , mr poettering , has already said , is going to vote in favour of this charter . 
moreover , this charter reflects the opinion of parliament , as we set it out in our duff / voggenhuber resolution on 16 march . 
the charter has been drawn up with the participation of a delegation from parliament and , as chairman of this delegation , i would like to thank all its members for their work , their commitment and their support over all these months . 
it is true , as one of the speakers said , that we have to make an effort to inform people about the charter , an effort that can begin in this parliament . 
when listening to the speeches from some members , one realises that this information is more necessary than ever . 
some people should read the charter before they speak to prevent them from saying the things that they say . 
mr president , allow me to say a few words on the effects of the charter . 
i think that there is a false debate . 
what prevented the achievement of both results is , minister , the same thing that will prevent the achievement of a satisfactory outcome in terms of democracy and effectiveness at nice : the obligation to reach unanimity on every single part of the text . 
those who are more backward and more reactionary have , once again , triumphed over those who are fighting to see fundamental rights applied to all people and for an effective , legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science , the rights of the new citizens , the right to a healthy environment etc. consequently , we are once again left disappointed and dissatisfied . 
we will , of course , vote for the charter , but we will do so with the feeling that it will not succeed in arousing that enthusiasm and that sense of participation by the citizens of europe which are so necessary and , as usual , it will be the government. and some governments more than other. who will have to bear the historical responsibility . 
mr president , it would be hard to deny that , for some years now , the social policies of the states of the union have been conditioned by economic and monetary policies , by budgetary concerns , by the stability pacts and by the flexible and precarious nature of employment , in homage to the great god of the marketplace and to competition , his inseparable companion . 
but this charter is clearly aimed at furthering the ever - closer union of the peoples of europe . 
according to the co - rapporteur , mr duff , this is a major step towards improving the quality of european integration . 
as a representative of my people in england , and not the european peoples , i can only say that i have no mandate to further european integratio. and if it truly represents its people neither does the uk government . 
in fact the bulk of the people in the united kingdom are wholly opposed to further integration . 
therefore , as a democrat , so am i. i dissociate myself from this initiative and will vote against . 
mr president , the charter gives visible form to existing rights , at the same time as historical steps are being taken on behalf of europe . 
ultimately , the debate is about whether the eu is to be founded upon normal constitutional principles . 
for those who feel the need to do so , i recommend reading the explanations in convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the treaty . 
if we really want to reinforce human rights at european level , we ought instead to employ our energy on strengthening the work of the council of europe and on having the eu ratify the european convention on human rights and the corresponding conventions on cultural and social rights , instead of slowly developing a system to compete with the council of europe , as we are now in the process of doing . 
indeed , the council of europe represents the whole of europe , or all european states . 
we have only fifteen of the. as yet . 
finally , there is the problem of wanting to establish a constitution without democratic backing . 
that will not get the voting numbers up at the next elections to the european parliament . 
mr president , the charter that is now on the table for our approval is a project we can be proud of . 
for the first time since the european union was established we have here the basis of a constitution , a constitution for the supranational structure that is the european union . 
it is a sound document in our view , and we feel it does justice to our standards and values as christian democrats . 
i regard it as the jewel in the crown of this charter . 
however , the institutions that are about to commit the solemn act of signing up to the charter must not just leave it to the lawyers to deal with . 
i support the first aim and reject the second . 
the draft charter of fundamental rights within the european union is a vague compromise between these two conflicting views , with the second taking precedence over the first . 
for some rights it will even mean a retrograde step . 
that is why this document is not yet ready for decision - making . 
in the short term , it is far more important for the european union to give its commitment to the already existing european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the council of europe . 
in the meantime , the draft charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties , trade unions , environmental organisations , churches and the many other groupings in the member states and the candidate states of the union , regarding future cooperation between european nations . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , power requires control . 
the european institutions have power and , for the sake of our citizens , we must set limits on this power . 
it is high time that we plugged the gaps in the protection of european fundamental rights . 
the debate as to whether the union should not simply accede to the european convention on human rights just as the member states do has gone on for years . 
i , for one , am delighted that , for a variety of reasons , the union has not acceded to the convention on human rights 
secondly , i wish to focus on the binding nature of this charter . 
the european public would not understand if europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights . 
in the conviction that the europe of the future must increasingly safeguard individual rights and the rights of the family and that it must prevent the return of new forms of racism and anti - semitism , the members of forza italia and the european people 's party will vote for the recommendation accompanying the charter of fundamental rights . 
mr president , first and foremost , i want to say thank you to the participants in the convention , both from parliament and from the commission and the council . 
i think some very skilful work has been done . 
the charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon . 
we shall shortly be officially adopting this charter as formally as possible and , i would hope , with the largest possible majority , and there will be any number of courts to draw conclusions from it even if it is not incorporated into the treaties in the immediate future . 
there is yet another effect it will have , and this is on our own working methods . 
let me give you an example of this . 
my fellow members on the committee on citizens ' freedoms , and rights , justice and home affairs did me the honour of appointing me rapporteur on the issue of respect for human rights within the europe union . 
mr president , the first problem , as i see it , with the european charter of fundamental rights , no matter how noble its intention , is the internal inconsistency of a document which , while referring only to european union institutions , strays into areas of jurisdiction where the eu has no current competenc. with potentially undesirable consequences . 
with all its imperfections and limitations , this text meets these needs . 
this is also true of the candidate countries , whose citizens are also hungry for rights and values . 
the charter therefore , i am convinced , properly belongs to the political acquis communautaire . 
you naturally raised the subject of the legal status of the charter in the course of the debate . 
i further note that there appears to be no clear majority within the european council in favour of granting it a binding status . 
we are building a major political edifice , and every brick in the wall counts . 
i therefore believe that a reasonable approach would be to consolidate the foundation we have in this charter and then to make ready for the next level . 
i have no doubt that it will come about in due course . 
the commissioner has just mentioned the spirit in which the charter was drawn up , with a view to its being made , one day , a binding text . 
just like him , i am convinced , firstly , that it will have singular effects in the immediate short term and , secondly , that it will shortly become binding . 
i think the criticism that the citizens of europe were not sufficiently involved in the process to be unfair in part . 
never in the history of european construction has the principle of transparency been applied with such determination and with such success . 
let me remind you that etuc , for example , representing 60 million employees in europe , was consulted , that several hundred ngos were consulted , that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the convention . 
the charter , furthermore , pays special attention to some of the more vulnerable categories of the population , such as the disabled , children or the aged . 
it also most forcefully affirms the equality of men and women in all areas , as well as the principle of non - discrimination . 
these rights are , i feel , expressed with unusual strength , and this is something on which the european union can pride itself . 
finally , the charter adopts the founding principles of the european union , highlighting the fundamental freedoms of the community whilst emphasising the value of european citizenship . 
here too , in specifying a right to good administration , the charter means to be ambitious . 
in the course of this debate , i have heard a number of telling phrases : the charter has been described as a bone thrown to keep the dog that is the european parliament quiet , or indeed as a flimsy attempt to conceal the fights relinquished by a french presidency that is on its last legs , seen especially in of the way in which it conducted the igc . 
we must applaud the remarkable efforts turkey has made , since the helsinki decision , in devising a programme to develop its judicial framework in order to meet eu demands in a more satisfactory manner , with particular regard to human rights . 
one example is the report drawn up under the responsibility of mr demirok , secretary of the turkish supreme coordination council for human rights , who has proposed a very wide - ranging raft of reforms to the constitution . 
however , we must also note and acknowledge that an awareness of the importance of these reforms has caused considerable upheavals in the various political parties and in turkish public opinion . 
this is why parliament has proposed the setting up of a europe - turkey forum involving expert representatives of the turkish community and appointed meps who would consider in depth the issues involved . 
turkish accession is too important a matter for the future of the union and of turkey itself for a decision to be taken in smoke - filled back rooms or behind closed doors . 
lengthy debates will be needed , both in the european parliament and in the national parliaments , and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult . 
customs union and the loans from the european investment bank have been operating with turkey for many years . 
the aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession . 
i repeat that the only serious problems that we could have would occur if the macro - financial aid promised reached the maximum amount established , as in this hypothesis the residual reserve for guarantees would be reduced to practically zero for 2001 and 2002 . 
let us remember that it is in the interests of the european union to fund nuclear safety projects in third countries in the framework of euratom . 
a zero level of residual reserve could lead to definite problems in funding those investments . 
i should like here , quite openly , to touch on the so - called armenian question . 
at a meeting which i , unfortunately , was unable to attend , my group decided by a majority to support amendment no 25 . 
as far as the content is concerned , there is little to say against this motion . unfortunately , however , a number of people are using the motions on armenia and the massacre of the armenians as a pretext to question , in a roundabout way , the very notion of turkey 's joining the european union . 
i think that is wrong and i think it is dangerous . nonetheless , i would urge turkey to take this issue seriously , whatever the outcome of the vote . 
we all have to come to terms with our own history and with the actions of our antecedent countries and states openly and honestly . 
i think that turkey should take a fresh approach and that it and armenia should commission their historians to analyse what happened in order to uncover , explain , take a clear stand on and clearly admit what happened . 
even if parliament is critical and even if parliament is perhaps more critical than the council and the commission can ever be , we trust that turkey will choose this way forward and will become a member of the european union just as soon as it has put its house in order . 
mr president , the european liberal group strongly welcomes the morillon report which we find skilful , frank and forceful . 
we will resist the efforts , some of them fairly spurious , to upset the balance the report successfully achieves , especially those amendments which seek to set up the european parliament as a tribunal upon the past . 
turkey is clearly the place for a debate on the past as part of its general self - examination concerning fundamental rights . 
such a self - appraisal will amount to a veritable cultural revolution . 
we should be satisfied that process is proven to have started . 
the morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the european union to turkey 's candidature . 
it is now up to turkey to show that it is committed to membership . 
turkish society obviously perceives this contradictory attitude . 
that is why the final problem to be resolved , the armenian genocide , is of such importance . 
i shall conclude as i began : the idea and purpose of my speech have been to draw attention to the fact that changes on this scale should not take place without a democratic , ongoing debate , otherwise the deficit in citizenship and participation that many europeans feel with regard to the model of european construction will continue to grow . 
mr president , the morillon report in itself provides a perfect illustration of the basic contradictions in the european attitude to turkey . 
this motion for a resolution contains anything and everything , with , in the first place , a great many illusions and a great many ritualistic recitals , which are , fortunately , immediately overtaken by reality , and this turkish reality obviously does not match european illusions or dreams . 
the suggestion that the europeans are going to bring about , i quote , " a radical change in habits and outlook " in the turks is both extremely naive and extremely self - important . 
what arrogance on the part of the european union to seek to foist its own values , institutional principles and political culture on the turkish nation ! 
the twentieth century has , however , proved the extent to which forms of constructivism and state control , cut off from reality , and ideologies of all sort could lead to disaster . 
let us therefore leave the turkish nation their right to self - determination , their right to decide their own future , their right to be different , and their right to retain values of civilisation that are patently not our own . 
such a clear stance would , among other things , at least have the merit of no longer blowing hot and cold with regard to turkish governments , no longer telling them , " yes but later " , " yes but on certain conditions " , " yes but this or that " . 
we cannot play about with the dignity of nations . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report troubles me . 
the problems are so serious as to preclude turkey 's accession in the foreseeable future . 
i should like to table three reservations : turkey has not even started to resolve the problem of the minorities living there . 
secondly , there is no end in sight to the dispute with greece over the island of cyprus , which still smoulders on . 
and thirdly , turkey 's criminal justice system , based as it still is on the death penalty and police torture , is unworthy of a western democracy . 
horrific pictures of serious maltreatment of detainees by the police were recently broadcast on german television . 
madam president , i feel it my duty to stress that we are being called upon to regulate , through the paciotti report and other directives and regulations which will be tabled before us , a great power : the power of information technology . 
data collection is not a painless operation and different types of database exist : confidential databases , cid databases , services database. in short , there is an enormous amount of power . 
this is why i was extremely happy to vote for this charter . 
arlette laguiller , armonia bordes and chantal cauquil voted against the charter , being aware that charters afford no real protection for workers in this class - ridden society where the only thing that counts is the balance of power . 
this charter refuses to include such basic rights as the right to a decent retirement pension , the right to a minimum wage , to decent housing , to health care . 
the text does not offer any additional protection and gives governments and the wealthy classes further arms to attack in these areas . 
the right to strike , for example , is acknowledged only with the proviso that it is limited " in accordance with national laws and practices " . 
the charter therefore has no binding force upon countries whose legislation does not go quite so far as the minimum contained in the charter . 
in countries whose legislation is more favourable to workers , however , the charter may be cited to oppose the national legislation in courts of law . 
instead of pulling human rights and social rights up to a higher level , the charter will enable actions that will effectively reduce them to the lowest common denominator . 
madam president , i did not take part in the vote on the charter of fundamental rights because i do not agree with the procedure : parliament has been unable to propose any amendments either to the text of the charter or even to the text of the recommendation . 
we had no choice but to take them or leave them . 
i do not consider this procedure to be correct and so i judged it appropriate not to take part in the vote . 
the charter of fundamental rights of the european union is a far cry from the declaration of human rights of the un , the european convention on human rights and the constitutions of many member states of the european union . 
the claim that this is the first time reference has been made to social rights does not stand up : there are references to social rights in international conventions such as the international labour conventions . 
for example , we note that : 
article 15 states that " everyone has the right to engage in work " but does not recognise the right to a paid job , 
article 16 recognises the freedom to conduct a business , the first international text to do so , 
article 28 allows employers to take anti - strike action ( lock out ) and sideline workers organisations in negotiations with employers , 
we are well aware of the fact that the charter may represent a step forward on certain issues for some countries . 
however , for most countries and in comparison with international provisions already in force , it represents a step backwards . 
our aim must be to progress , not to go from bad to worse . 
the meps of the communist party of greece voted against this text , which is both useless and dangerous . 
. ( fr ) the adoption of the charter of fundamental rights would be justified if we already had a european state based on a constitution adopted by universal suffrage , but that is not the case today . 
the rights contained in the charter are already included in national constitutions and safeguarded by national parliaments close to the nations of europe and their cultures . 
moreover , the charter is a compromise based on the lowest common denominator , which will be detrimental to social advantages acquired by law in a good number of european member states . 
the right to housing , for example , has been reduced to the right to " housing assistance " , while the right to work has been replaced by the " right of access to placement services " . 
no restriction has been placed upon freedom of expression , implying that it would not henceforth be possible to bring prosecutions against criminal statements , such as incitement to racial hatred and violence . 
. ( fr ) the charter of fundamental rights of the european union adopted today by the european parliament is a highly significant document . 
admittedly , there are still a number of shortcomings in both form and content . 
i believe that the draft charter is a bad product which ought not to be taken any further . 
. ( fr ) i consider that the charter of fundamental rights represents a valuable step forward . 
i nonetheless abstained from the final vote , because i feel that some social rights are expressed less clearly than the economic rights . 
both the ' right to work ' and the ' right to strike ' are handled only indirectly . 
the charter lists the fundamental freedoms to which my fellow citizens are entitled , but there is no mention of a requirement upon anyone to respect the rights of others . 
a society which recognises only rights and not duties becomes selfish . 
however , what worries us most is that the twin - track jurisdiction of the european court of justice and the european court of human rights will give rise to inconsistent case law , resulting in the unequal treatment of citizens in these sensitive areas , in breach of their fundamental rights . 
we are also convinced that merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in - depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments . 
. one of the great criticisms of the eu in britain is that it appears to go beyond what was intended when competences were granted to it , both in depth of detail and in scope of application . 
we , in the conservative party , are looking into ways of ring - fencing competence which will run with the letter and spirit of the treaties and recognise the position of the member states at the heart of the european political process . 
enumerating and entrenching the inalienable characteristics of the system which guarantee rights to individuals and define the limits of the political process , across a number of member states which comprise a single quasi - domestic legal area , offers a fruitful avenue to explore , to try to achieve these desirable ends . 
if citizens are to feel involved in the european union , its policies and institutions , then it is up to the members of parliament in particular to disclose more of the critical decisions , the contradictions , the divergent interests and projects driving the economic and social operators within the european arena . 
everyday topical events , from maritime transport to animal meal , show us that the markets and economic operators must be much better regulated and controlled and that established short - term profit - making interests must be opposed . 
we need better european legislation to improve the quality of life for all and to improve social welfare systems . 
this is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions . 
. ( fr ) the social democrats promised us that europe would cease to be just an economic market , a single currency and a liberalising machine . 
enhanced with a " charter of fundamental rights " , social europe would at long last take on a social character . 
but nothing of the sort has been achieved . 
this charter represents a social step backwards as regards democracy and freedoms , falling short of the terms of the treaties currently in force . 
great pressure had to be exerted before the right to join trade unions and the right to strike were at last included . 
except for a few general comments , women have the right to " marry " and " found a family " , while immigrants have the right not to be subjected to " collective expulsion " . 
social rights simply do not feature . 
there is no right to work , just the " right to engage in work " ; there is no right to social protection or accommodation , just " the right to social assistance and housing assistance " ; there is no right to a retirement pension or a minimum income ; there is no ban on redundancies , just the " right to protection against unjustified dismissal " . 
in fact , the fight against social exclusion is relegated to the level of assistance , instead of imposing a requirement for basic rights binding upon employers and states . 
yet , on the other hand , the charter of course gives the right to property and the freedom to conduct a business more than their due . 
for all the above reasons , this charter must not be incorporated into the treaties of the european union , and we cannot accept the text as it is currently worded . 
. ( fr ) the procedure adopted for framing and adopting the charter of fundamental rights really only leaves the european parliament with a simple choice : to either accept or reject the current charter . 
given that only have two options , my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this charter represents , however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text . 
first of all we should take another look at the approach adopted . 
while the convention method is a valuable one , and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise , all the same nothing can justify depriving the european parliament , the physical representatives of the peoples of europe , of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text . 
yet when a historian looks into the way in which the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and the citizen or other similar international declarations were drawn up , he perceives the extent to which parliamentary debate and the amendment process were able to lend inspiration , significance and also ambition to these fundamental texts which are still powerful today . 
at this time when debate in the institutions of europe is being undertaken concomitantly with the charter being adopted , all those men and women who , like myself , would like a european constitution and consider that this charter may serve as the bare bones for the preamble to such a constitution should demand that the european parliament be enabled to vote on the content , as part of its normal parliamentary business , which is basically deliberative . 
in connection with this institutional debate , it is essential to incorporate the charter into the treaties of the european union so that the rights that have been declared can be guaranteed for all and the state policies required to implement them can be developed either by the member states or by the european union itself , without conflicting with the existing legal texts . 
it must be acknowledged that the law of free competition and the single market too often prevails over all other requirements and effectively flouts social rights and fundamental rights . 
we have seen too many declarations that were not followed up in practice . 
this is therefore the first priority : we must give this charter real legal force . 
next , the actual content of the charter is ambiguous and inadequate on some counts . 
in the first place , there are discrepancies between the german and french versions which raise major questions about the references to " religious " or " spiritual " values . 
personally , i am convinced that secularism is a liberating factor for the modern world . 
i deplore the ambiguity of these terms and also the lack of a clearer reference to secularity . 
secondly , the right to work is not directly stated . 
the citizens ' europe we are striving for must establish such recourse . 
for these reasons i abstained from voting during the plenary session of the european parliament . 
. i voted for the charter of fundamental rights as a declaration of intent . 
the basic clauses are not in dispute and should be supported by everyone . 
there will be no shift in the balance of power between the eu and member states . 
this charter is a declaratory document and clarifies the eu positio. especially to those seeking to join the enlarged europe . 
we must , however , stand firmly against any campaign for a legally binding charter that would only create legal uncertainty . 
this document is clearly not one suited to become legally binding as it is not a legal text . 
. ( pt ) i abstained in the vote on the charter of fundamental rights because i felt that , before this was adopted or rejected , it was crucial to know what fate it would meet at the nice european council . 
in future , will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for community institutions and , consequently , for the european public ? 
we are very familiar with the position held by the majority in this parliament . 
in this catalogue of rights , the devotees of european federalism see the embryo of a future european constitution , which the member states ' national constitutions will have to accommodate . 
we understand their position when they try to give a qualitatively diverse political meaning to a text on fundamental rights , which is not only vague and all - encompassing , but is also going to be of arguable usefulness in an eu that has no serious shortcomings , either in the legal status of its rights or in the way in which these rights are defended and implemented . 
fortunately the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the sensible path to take , which is to see the charter as having power that is merely political rather than binding . 
the great political debate on the charter will therefore take place firstly between national governments and then , eventually , when this parliament is confronted with their decision . 
in the light of ireland 's national position and in tune with the wishes of my constituents , i must vote against this charter of fundamental human rights which , despite being a simple political statement at this time is , by all evidence , intended to be the preamble to a european constitution which will take precedence over the constitution of my country and the will of the irish people . 
. ( fr ) i voted , most decidedly , against the draft charter of fundamental rights before us . 
i did so primarily to denounce the anti - democratic way in which it was produced . 
from start to finish , the framing of the charter gave rise to a series of takeovers by force : 
a semantic appropriation , at the outset , regarding the name of the body drafting the charter . 
established as " a body " by the cologne summit , it declared itself a " convention " , a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the french revolution degenerated into the reign of terror under another " convention " . 
the limitations of the rule of consensus applied in this sort of context may be gauged by observing the ubuesque and frankly grotesque choices it gives rise to . 
ultimately there is nothing european about the text of the charter . 
as it stands , it could be adopted by just about any country in the whole world . 
the lot of processes of this nature is to produce texts which necessarily boil down to the lowest common denominator . 
the value of the content of such an exercise , quite apart from its illegitimacy , given that the european union has no jurisdiction in the field of human rights , cannot clearly be seen since , in europe , our freedoms are protected remarkably well by the founding texts of our nations and by the european convention on human rights . 
the method used , the cuts made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of the text , on the other hand , shed a harsh light on the new totalitarian agitators at work at the very heart of the process of european integration . 
marinho report ( a5 - 0313 / 2000 ) 
madam president , mr marinho 's document is a step towards establishing the future european criminal legal system . 
pensioners are in favour of strengthening criminal law , european law especially , as well as national law , for i am afraid that crimes are no longer committed solely by our citizens but by people of other nationalities as well . 
pensioners and elderly people fall victim to criminal acts more frequently than anyone els. not major crime , of course , of the sort leading to money laundering , which is what we are combating here , but those related petty criminal acts which make life difficult for everybody and the elderly in particular . 
. ( fr ) last night we examined four draft texts on combating organised crime which , on the whole , are to be welcomed , even if the reports and amendments from the european parliament are themselves more questionable . 
these texts have two points in common . 
next , these texts are all based on initiatives by member states , coming under either the third pillar of article 67 of the treaty establishing the european community , where the commission does not have the monopoly on the right of initiative . 
if we set minimum penalties in this framework resolution , we shall come up against elementary rule of law problems . 
if we set minimum penalties , we shall be contradicting cleverly worked - out national criminal codes . 
we need to approximate , not unify our criminal codes . 
under the rule of law and democracy , criminal codes represent very core of national sovereignty and the member states should therefore be left to set them . 
. i welcome this report . 
special action against money laundering was proposed in tampere in 1999 . 
the european council , noting that serious forms of crime increasingly have tax and duty aspects , called upon the members states to provide full mutual legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of this type of crime and for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering . 
it was accepted that the principle of mutual recognition should also apply to pre - trial orders , in particular to those which would enable competent authorities quickly to secure evidence and seize assets , which are easily moveable . 
through this initiative the french presidency proposes the adoption of a framework decision for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering ( e.g. tracing , freezing and confiscating funds ) . 
the adoption of this report and the french initiative will undoubtedly assist in the fight against money laundering . 
-- ( nl ) there is often a fine line between business activities and white - collar crime . 
the drugs and arms trades , illegal waste dumping , leaving consumers non - plussed with poor quality products , banking secrecy and tax havens undoubtedly contribute to the much championed economic growth . 
yet they clearly run counter to the interests of human beings and the conservation of our environment . 
the right to property appears almost to be sacrosanct . 
that was the case a century ago , and although there was a crack down , it is now back in full force . 
therefore any move to improve our chances of depriving those who profit from illegal financial practices of their gains , is a step in the right direction . 
this subject has also been seized on with a view to enhancing cooperation between european police forces . 
money laundering feeds the trade in drug - trafficking . 
existing eu law is clearly not enough to stem the tide of the reported usd 590 billion which is laundered world - wide every year . 
we welcome the french presidency 's initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties . 
all member states should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years ' imprisonment . 
further measures are being voted on by the european parliament this week in our efforts to crack down on international crime . 
we are looking to extend the remit of europo. the european police cooperation uni. to cover serious international crime . 
we also want to remove legal barriers which prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds . 
this shows , once again , that the member states have a long way to go in understanding the meaning of shared sovereignty . 
moreover , i should point out , as a member representing basques and catalans , that there continues to be an emphasis on cooperation between states , without taking into account that in the eu other police forces operate that are not state bodies . 
this report and , in general , the area of freedom , safety and justice in europe , is based on democracy and on the rule of law that should reign in the eu . 
however , i would like to draw your attention to the possible reforms of criminal law that could take place in various member states such as spain , for example , with the partido popular in powe. which is taking advantage of a certain situatio. because these reforms are still a concern for the europe of freedom and democracy . 
the draft convention proposes that banking secrecy may not be used as a reason to refuse a request from another member state for information on somebody suspected of being involved in financial crime . 
in addition , the idea is that , on request , member states should furnish details of all bank accounts held by suspects . 
the aim of the new convention is to oblige the member states actively to pursue suspicious transactions . 
gebhardt report ( a5 - 0317 / 2000 ) 
madam president , this is a documen. which i voted fo. which is intended to establish gradually , step by step , a european public prosecution service . 
in fact , a provisional cooperation unit is being set up , composed of a representative of the judges or police officers with equivalent competence from each of our 15 member states . 
however , i would have hoped that this body would also have included representatives of the lawyers of each of the 15 states , for i feel that , at a time when we have to establish something new in the legal area , it would be beneficial to consult not only the judges who judge but also the lawyers , who have a great deal of experience in the field . 
we are also strongly opposed to the ambition to make the eu into a constitutional state by establishing ' independent legislative , executive and judiciary ' bodies ' with counterbalancing powers ' . 
it is still the member states , as constitutional states , which must be at the heart of european cooperation . 
that is why we are voting against the report . 
langenhagen report ( a5 - 0310 / 2000 ) 
madam president , this is the only report which i voted against . 
apart from declarations of intent , so far turkey has made no fundamental progress towards meeting the political criteria . 
consequently , there is even more need now , almost one year on from helsinki , for turkey 's accession prospects to be debated in our national parliaments and with our citizens . 
we owe it both to turkey and to our own people , and this sort of discussion will perhaps help to integrate the turkish immigrants already living in our midst . 
mr president , if turkey were a member of the eu , it would be the most populous member state after germany . 
we see it as a matter of great urgency for the eu , through the eib , to support development so that turkey might as soon as possible set a practical process in motion with a view to fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . 
in practical terms , this is about the opportunities for granting loans for projects in turkey amounting to eur 450 million between now and 2004 . 
while there is a special relationship between azerbaijan and turkey , this is far from being the case for armenia , a country against which turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade , which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the european union . 
the dispute relating to acknowledgement of the armenian genocide should also be waived in order to enable diplomatic and trade relations to be normalised , especially as turkey plays a key role in the project for the construction of an oil pipeline taking petroleum from the caspian sea to the turkish port of ceyhan on the mediterranean . 
turkey also needs to take on board environmental considerations , particularly in schemes such as the construction of major dams , which will necessarily have an impact on the water systems of neighbouring countries . 
mr president , i should like to congratulate general morillon on what is , under the circumstances , a most balanced report . 
we all know how difficult it is under such difficult circumstances to deal efficiently with successive efforts to serve political , economic and other purposes and interests at the expense of principles and rules of law and generally using two yardsticks and two sets of scales . 
that is why the frankness which runs through the morillon report deserves special mention , although fewer excuses at some points in the report would , i think , have reflected the factors used to evaluate turkey 's progress towards accession more accurately . 
in this context , i would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that turkey does not meet the copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights , democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the european parliament 's recommendations that turkey comply with the relevant european values . 
something along these lines might have been more helpful , including for turkey , because it would have sent a more accurate message to the forces in turkey which really do intend to modernise the country and it would have supported their efforts to put conditions in place which guarantee its european prospects , giving them serious arguments with which to convince the many sceptics that those prospects are , in fact , well - founded . 
he himself referred to this genocide as if it were something forgotten . 
turkey must come to terms with the truth . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr morillon has made a comment under recital d in his report which should , i think , play an important role in this debate . 
mr morillon says that turkey should try not to perceive the european union as an exclusive christian club which wants to keep it , turkey , out . 
this premise presupposes that the opposite holds true within the european union , i.e. that we are not an exclusive christian club which wants , can or should exclude turkey on relativistic religious or cultural grounds . 
the premise should be that a country with a laicistic constitution inhabited predominantly by moslems which is based on the values on which the european union itself is founde. i.e. freedom , equality and toleranc. could enrich the european union . 
the european union is not founded on religious values , it is founded on values which we owe to the enlightenment and which , quite independently of the religious leanings of a person or a country and its inhabitants , find their way into the constitutions of the member states and , as we have seen during today 's debate on the charter of fundamental rights , into the eu 's perception of fundamental rights . 
this means that , as a democratic state under the rule of law with separation of powers and fundamental values as we understand them , turkey will enrich the european union . 
at the same time , however , it is clear from mr morillon 's report that turkey is nowhere near meeting these demands . 
the copenhagen criteria are , admittedly , economic criteria , but they are also criteria which are centred around precisely these points . 
the question is , how far have tolerance , democratic rule of law , separation of powers and respect for the separation of powers been put into practice in turkey ? 
and the answer is , as mr morillon 's report makes clear , not far enough . 
too little progress has been made and turkey must do better . 
mr president , this debate is not about how the european union will integrate into turkey ; it is about how turkey will integrate into the european union . 
i agree with that entirely and i think that the report by the honourable member shows how this can be achieved . 
i should therefore like to turn to the commissioner and the president - in - office and ask them , given their level of support for the morillon repor. as they themselves have said - , why they were so lacking in inspiration and loath to include in the accession partnership which they formulated issues such as the kurds , the cyprus question and peaceful , non - threatening coexistence with turkey 's neighbouring countries , issues which have been left out of the basic debate with turkey . 
as far as the armenian genocide is concerned i fully agree that it should not be a precondition to turkey 's accession . 
however , the debate here is about what we have to say and what we remember . 
turkey will become an essentially democratic country once it learns to live with its past , just as democratic germany has learned to live with its pas. we asked the same of it . 
we want to support it on this journey , not obstruct it and , above all , we want to keep our financial promises . 
terrorism has been a barrier to such progress . 
we should also be clear that the resolution of extraordinarily difficult problems such as cyprus , which requires the assent of all the people of cyprus , will not be helped by frustrating turkish progress towards accession . 
the enthusiasm with which the resolution welcomes turkey 's intention to commit military capabilities under the common security and defence policy is in keeping with the general tone of the report . 
in other words , we are talking about increasing the degree to which turkey is subject to the economic , political and military objectives of big business in the european union . 
we have not , of course , overlooked the positive references in the resolution , such as the reference to human rights , despite the fact that it mistakes manipulation of the status quo for progress and ignores the 10,000 - 15,000 political prisoners . 
there are also positive references to cyprus , with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn , to the need to implement the decisions of the european court , as in the loïzidou case , to the need for a political solution to the kurdish question and to the bombings in iraq . 
but we are afraid that , yet again , they are no more than a wish list . 
why is none of this included in the european commission 's report ? 
for us , the basic issue is this : despite numerous allegations to the contrary , not only has turkey failed to improve the standard of living of its people , in certain sectors it has made it worse since customs union in 1995 and the declaration of candidate status in 1999 . 
there can be no doubt that the accession process and accession itself will reduce their quality of life , especially in the economic and social sectors . 
i therefore think we must encourage the turkish authorities to forge ahead in order to achieve the necessary compliance with the copenhagen political criteria . 
at the same time , we must continue to be vigilant with regard to the actual implementation of the measures that have been announced . 
the strategy adopted in helsinki last december marked a turning point in relations between the european union and turkey . 
it is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the european union and turkey . 
so , in conclusion , let me say : let us be demanding , let us be vigilant , let us set our terms but , let us not be excessive in our demands , as we too must live up to our commitments and the european union made an important decision in helsinki . 
mr president , i should like to close the debate by pointing out that there is , of course , a link between the commission report on the progress that has been made , or not made , in turkey and the accession partnership . 
several speakers have criticised the fact that the commission failed to address certain problems . 
i can only assume that these speakers have not read the report , because all the problems referred to here , which the commission allegedly failed to address , are dealt with in the report . 
i must defend myself against the impression created here that the terminology of the 2000 report differs from that of the 1999 report . 
it does not . 
what is new is the accession partnership , and the accession partnership contains a very important stipulation : that the candidate country must deal with all the issues addressed in the progress report . 
in other words there is an internal link here . 
however , we must never forget that it will take two sides to resolve this issue , not just one . 
it is , moreover , the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the barcelona process , in order to be in a position , in marseilles , to establish the necessary guidelines . 
priorities for the implementation of this common strategy have already been established by the presidency and were presented to the council of ministers in september . 
the presidency strove particularly to identify areas on which the european union and its partners of the southern mediterranean should concentrate their efforts in order to reinvigorate the barcelona process , particularly by intensifying political and economic dialogue , improving the effectiveness of community aid , the implementation of sub - regional cooperation and south - south integration , and even intensifying initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs . 
the main thing , in my view , is that work is going forward and that the project is not being abandoned . 
in this respect , i believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit . 
let us not forget that the barcelona process is a recent development , only five years old . 
indeed , when we instigated the partnership in 1995, we were aware that we were undertaking a long - term project . 
there was plainly nothing easy about the task of bringing together , overnight , 27 partners as diverse as this against an often tense , and occasionally more than tense political background and within a framework as original as the barcelona arrangement . 
yet , we have managed to maintain dialogue even on occasionally sensitive subjects : stability , terrorism , emigration and human rights , for example . 
you may rest assured that we fully intend to continue in this way . 
cooperation in the field of politics and security , known as the ' first aspect ' of the barcelona process is essential , even though we know it is the most sensitive and the longest to implement . 
there are also , however , the other ' aspects ' of barcelona , the economic and financial aspect on the one hand , and the social , cultural and human aspect on the other . 
finally , as mr brok emphasised , we have common challenges , which we must meet together in order to deal with racism , intolerance and xenophobia . 
great prospects are opening up , too , for cooperation in the areas of combating trafficking of all sorts , migration and enhancing the rule of law . 
we europeans have experience that we can profitably share . 
it is furthermore in our own interests to support our partners in their process of structural reforms , upgrading and opening up their economies to competition . 
furthermore , there are still the eib loans , which are essential to the development of our partner countries , particularly its major infrastructure projects . 
i feel that with an allocation of several billion euros for the mediterranean region over the period 2000 - 2007, we shall be in a position to fulfil the expectations of our partner countries in the south over the next few years , and that is crucial . 
mr president , five years on from the barcelona conference , it is time to take stock of the situation . 
last march , the european parliament approved a resolution which made a critical analysis of the policies and instruments of the partnership , proposing some substantial changes . 
in june 2000, the feira council adopted a common mediterranean strategy and , after proposing and obtaining endorsement for reform of the meda regulation , the commission recently tabled a document on reinvigorating the barcelona process . 
all this shows that we are aware of how inadequate the results achieved thus far have been , although i feel that the responses are not yet sufficient to deal with the situation , even though it is true that five years are certainly not a very long time over which to judge such complex processes . 
the third constraint concerns the regrettable involvement of the european and mediterranean civil societies in this process , which is still too dominated by centralism and the almost exclusive role of the governments . 
i have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the process , and the enhancement of the barcelona political agenda must be added to all this . 
it is , in fact , inconceivable that the agricultural policy , the control of migration flows and the debt should not be at the centre of the euro - mediterranean project now . 
as regards agriculture , i would like to point out that parliament has undertaken to organise a conference next spring . 
moreover , the tragic interruption of the middle east peace process is changing the situation in the region . 
the free trade area is in danger of considerably intensifying these imbalances , even though there is an urgent need , instead , for greater collaboration in order to meet needs . 
i am thinking in particular of public services , more especially in the areas of water , education , health , public transport and housing . 
this partnership will have no future unless it has the benefit of close cooperation with the representatives of the citizens concerned , the associations , the ngos , the trade unions and civil society as a whole . 
moreover , the dream of peace on both sides of the mediterranean should be listened to and the wish granted at the earliest possible opportunity . 
the spiralling violence in the middle east , the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the palestinian people , whose right to statehood is still being denied by israel , are all threatening the future of the entire region . 
the european union must , as the palestinian leaders expressly request , henceforth take bold action in order to put an end to the gunfire , to promote effective dialogue and actively militate in favour of applying the un resolutions . 
these last few days in marseilles , i have observed the great numbers of speakers addressing such comments to the conference of ministers , speaking in favour of cancelling debt and replacing free trade with relations of mutually supportive codevelopment.. . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , the different areas of the euro - mediterranean dialogue must , in my opinion , be tackled from the social , political and cultural perspectives , in continuation of that proces. the euro - mediterranean conferenc. which was set in motion in barcelona in 1995 when we first started to talk about mediterranean policy , although the complexity of the subject caused some difficulties even then . 
the world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and , as a result , is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition . 
this is prompting the europe of national states to form a single political , economic and commercial entity in order to organise and boost a market of over 350 million consumers and set it on a level with other markets . 
to this end , we need to establish suitable structures , which could be both political and economic . 
however , first and foremost , we need political strategies which are free of bureaucracy . 
europe is the guardian of great values : peace , freedom and social progress , values which must be protected day in day out precisely because they are the result of victories won at the cost of great sacrifice . 
europe 's economic progress is now under threat from the current globalisation process , and our continent is in serious danger of a recession caused by competition from south - east asi. where the cost of labour is a tenth of the cost of labour in europ. the usa and japan . 
the mediterranean policy is now operating in a world of extremely varied interests and latent stabilisation , and it must therefore include certain elements such as the development of peace - keeping initiative. but it must not , i would stress , be limited to thi. and the creation of partnership projects which involve northern and southern europe , precisely because the objective of making the mediterranean an area of dialogue , tolerance and cooperation and a guarantee of peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will or without the lasting , well - balanced social and economic development of less - favoured peoples and the social development of the coastal peoples , improving their employment possibilities , in order to put an end to the multitude of problems caused by the tremendous number of emigrants leaving the basin and now affecting all the countries of the union . 
we are therefore convinced that the union 's mediterranean policy must take account of the mediterranean basin and therefore treat the mediterranean as a project , mindful of the fact that the rights of peoples take priority over the rights of individuals , if only because , when all is said and done , conflicts between nations harm the life and development of the individual citizens . 
braudel 's ' mediterranean of a thousand things ' , the ancient civilisations which , for years , have regarded each other with hostility across the basin , now have the opportunity to start afresh , setting off along a common path which , through political will and the power of dialogue , will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development . 
mr president , in nice the european union will need to strike a balance between integration and enlargement and in marseilles it will need to strike a balance between its function in central europe and its responsibility in the mediterranean . 
we need to set priorities ; in other words , we need to use the enlargement process to strengthen europe from the centre outwards and force a stabilisation process in south - east europe and in the western balkans , but without neglecting the barcelona process , which has been drifting for five years now . 
we can hypothesise as to whether a decisive , uniform eu policy in the balkans might have prevented the balkan war and the european union might therefore have avoided the consequential costs of the war . 
now , on the eve of marseilles , we need to ensure that aid is not given to the balkans at the expense of the meda programme or vice versa and that everything stays within the financial framework agreed in berlin . 
with these conditions in place , it should be possible for the special council in marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the eu . 
we must ensure that the meda aid programme is not delayed by bureaucratic hurdles for which the commission is to blame and that projects are identified more quickly in future by the mediterranean countries involved . 
it is disappointing to see that the mediterranean countries only called up just under a quarter of the eur 4.7 billion budget of the meda i programme which expired in 1999 . 
but this also illustrates that we need to estimate the absorption capacity of the countries bordering the mediterranean more realistically . 
i therefore particularly welcome the commission plan to speed up the association agreement and i think that the revision of the meda regulation was a very good move . 
so far , i have deliberately avoided making any link between the euro - mediterranean conference and the conflict in the middle east . 
the very fact that this conference is even taking place and that israel and the palestinians have agreed to attend and the threat of boycott by the arab league has come to nothing must qualify as a success . 
we can only hope that this conference in marseilles does not turn into a platform for polemics , pushing the first important signs of a mediterranean policy in the european union and the revival of the barcelona to one side . 
mr president , tomorrow and the following day the euro - mediterranean conference is to be held in marseilles , attended by all the countries that signed the barcelona declaration , and i think that we can congratulate ourselves on this . 
it will be a success that will show that the barcelona process , which began on the back of the oslo agreements , has reached a sufficient level of maturity and solidity to prevent it from being caught up in the difficulties of the middle east process . 
moreover , by continuing it can make the best possible contribution , a secondary but significant contribution , to the resumption of dialogue in the middle east . 
however , in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the barcelona process , many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing , due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from israel , the palestinian authority , syria and lebanon , etc. and this is , perhaps , a sad consolation . 
the evaluation is now a contrasting one and , of course , the strategic development of euro - mediterranean policy cannot depend on a temporary evaluation . 
it is continuity over time that can provide results , and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern mediterranean . 
those countries come up against a great deal of problems finding a place for their development and economic integration in the context of globalisation and we must do everything in our power to help restore balance to a situation characterised by gulfs between north and south . 
if current tendencies continue we can be pessimistic about the future . 
i hope that when the conference of ministers of the union meets in marseilles , it will be able to adopt a position on this matter which is coherent with what is always pompously stressed , that human rights must not be violated . 
it is essential to reinvigorate the process and we must do so , but we must do so in the knowledge that we cannot escape the central issue of the mediterranean . 
mr president , since the barcelona conference and now on the eve of the marseilles conference , as has already been said , a great deal has taken place in the mediterranean region . 
it is true that this conference is going to take place in a context of violence and of a peace crisis as a result of the conflict in the middle east , but it is also true that holding the conference will enable us to keep the flame of the euro - mediterranean process burning and that it should not be contaminated by the tragic conflict . 
there are many common problems that are currently affecting the euro - mediterranean area : illegal immigration , poverty , foreign debt , human rights , drought and terrorism , which mercilessly destroys the lives of innocent individuals and families , as we are tragically experiencing in spain , algeria and the middle east . 
now more than ever we need to proclaim that only regional cooperation , dialogue with civil society , economic and cultural exchange , solidarity and mutual understanding can make the two shores of the mediterranean a prosperous and peaceful area . 
the commission and the council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the mediterranean region viable . 
we cannot and must not waste our human resources , our agricultural , industrial or traditional craftsmanship resources which , along with such vital products as oil , gas and new technologies , should be basic tools for the development of a mediterranean society that is much more balanced , fair and competitive than at present . 
mr president , i will come back to the conflict in the middle east ; not two months ago , the presidents of the israeli parliament and the palestinian assembly united in this house with the president of the european parliament , in a plea for peace and harmony , and we all joined in hearty applause for that gesture . 
when weapons replace words , dialogue and understanding , the foundation and substance of democracy that is parliament fails , and this is also our failure . 
it is a warning call to the european union to play a much more active role in the mediterranean area , which historically and culturally has enriched our european continent . 
it would be an error not to take on the leading role that history requires of us . 
the commission and the council claim to want this . 
we are willing to believe them , but the countries of the south need more than just promises and speeches , and it is up to us to give them those things . 
marseilles too , the other summit , brought together the members of associations , trade unions and political bodies from all around the mediterranean , and these people were together attempting resolutely to find solutions to meeting the needs of their peoples . 
as far as i am concerned , this necessarily involves using new means , and hence cancelling debt . 
what is much more serious , however , at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view , often very divergent ones , within this chamber , more and more palestinians are being killed . 
the european union must , as a matter of urgency , strongly condemn the israeli attacks on the palestinian people , whose demand to live in peace in their own state is a legitimate one and one which must , therefore , be met . 
mr president , europe is sometimes in a great hurry , and sometimes being in a hurry makes you leave things behind . 
and i have seen that in all these documents on strengthening the barcelona agreement we are forgetting some things . 
one of them is that liberalisation , a single market , cannot be established without taking care of some important aspects , such as people and culture or education . 
if we liberalise the markets and encourage a drive to integrate them while forgetting this , we run the risk of ultimately achieving colonisation rather than cooperation . 
europe needs to think outside the principle of subsidiarity or go beyond it and realise that it needs to provide a great deal of aid in order to raise the level in the recipient countries , among both men and women , not only of basic education but also of minimum education , which in europe is considered to be for all citizens . 
therefore , we cannot just talk about products and the organisation of markets without thinking about those citizens . 
secondly , i think that we are also forgetting another important subject , which is the environment . 
2000 / 0112 ( cns ) ] 
a5 - 0330 / 2000 by mr westendorp y cabeza , on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , on the amended proposal for a council regulation on assistance for albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , the federal republic of yugoslavia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and amending regulation ( eec ) no 3906 / 89, decision 97 / 256 / ec and regulation ( eec ) no 1360 / 90 [ com ( 2000 ) 62 . 
c5 - 0525 / 200 . 
2000 / 0111 ( cns ) ] 
in other words , the proposal now on the table reflects this discussion , and as i see it , is also a first example of how we should do things in the future . 
i happened to be at a conference in zagreb last week , when once again it became evident how important it is not to teach future generations of mini balkans citizen. as it wer. old stereotypes , or inculcate them with notions of ' the enemy ' , and instead , to made a fresh start in this respect . 
we cannot adopt a regulation here in parliament knowing full well that the funds required to implement it will not be available . 
that is why this is stage one of the battle for an effective system of delivering aid to the balkans . 
stage two will take place in december when our colleagues in the committee on budgets , but ultimately parliament as a whole , will have to opt for a sound financial basis for this regulation . 
hence my appeal for this regulation to strike a good balance between high profile activities , i.e. large projects , on the one hand , and continued attention to projects for democracy , on the other , i.e. projects to do with security , projects that are seldom as high profile , but which are all the more necessary to guarantee stability in the balkans . 
then there is the question of the agency in kosovo . 
seen in a positive light , i sometimes think , and hope , that the agency , by the manner in which it has operated to date , and in which it is to function in the future , ought to serve as an example of how aid should be delivered to the balkans , and also to other parts of the world . 
i have drawn such positive conclusions from my various visits to the agency because as i see it , despite al. and i repeat , al. the mistakes that are made there , there can be no doubt that they have found a new and effective way to deliver aid . 
if we then talk about increasing efficiency , which is the overall objective of this regulation , and relate this to the agency in kosovo , then we have no choice but to reduce the involvement of the member states . 
as far as i am concerned , and this is one of the key messages in my report on the agency , the role of the member states in aid provision will be much reduced in future because there is evidence to show that their involvement causes delays . 
the agency is now based in kosovo , and the council has decide. rightly to my min. to extend its scope to serbia and montenegro . 
i feel we will have to call it a day at that point because we can draw a lesson from the work that the agency is doing now , i.e. physical reconstruction , with a view to carrying out the same activities to good effect in serbia and montenegro . 
delivering aid to the balkans within the framework of cards , to countries such as croatia , albania , and macedonia , demands other special qualities and other capabilities . 
in addition , there are several measure . i am referring particularly to the cards programm. that should go beyond reconstruction and extend to training , education and the reconstruction of civil society in close collaboration with ngos . 
it is vital that ngos should collaborate in this field , and also that there should be some coordination among them , if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions . 
we must also highlight the media . 
the media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through , so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies . 
sometimes there is too much bureaucracy , too much red tape , and too much vacillation when the aid is granted . 
therefore it is important for the cards programme management committee to be a committee that confines itself to the general lines of multiannual planning and does not try to carry out everyday micro - management at too detailed a scale , because otherwise we may again have the same problems as in the past . 
it is also important that the work of the cards management committee and the work of the kosovo reconstruction agency should not get mixed up , or be duplicated or overlap ; instead there should be a perfect division of duties . 
it is also essential to strengthen the role of the european parliament , and i believe that with the amendments , which are likely to be voted for tomorrow , the european parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration . 
the government in zagreb is helping us to think about the future of the region , and making real investments in democracy and stability . 
tomorrow we are due to receive the new president of yugoslavia in this house . 
as i see it , they are the new heroes of the balkans and of course they are more than welcome . 
croatia must soon be given the opportunity to strengthen its ties with the european union . 
as far as i am concerned , apart from slovenia it will be the first country from former yugoslavia to qualify for eu membership in the future . 
what serbia deserves most of all at this point in time is material aid , and the sooner the better . 
europe must clearly demonstrate that its aid is making a difference , even before the parliamentary elections in serbia . 
i read in some reports about the elections in bosnia that the extreme nationalists have won at the parliamentary elections held in bosnia herzegovina . 
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all aware that the western balkans present a significant challenge for the european union and the credibility of its foreign policy , due to the scale of our human , political and financial commitment in the region , and also our desire to facilitate stabilisation through the construction , development and finally reintegration of the balkan region into the european family . 
this year began on a positive note with democratic change in croatia , as a result of the parliamentary and presidential elections it held . 
it continued with another major event in the form of the victory of democratic forces in the federal republic of yugoslavia and the fall of milosevic . 
we indeed hope that the year will end with the consolidation of democracy on 23 december during the parliamentary elections in serbia . 
as you will be aware , the european union , has contributed significantly to these historic developments . 
it reacted immediately to the new order in croatia , by undertaking the process that will lead , at the zagreb summit on 24 november , in other words in ten days ' time , to the opening of negotiations aimed at concluding a stabilisation and association agreement with this country . 
i should like to speak in more detail about the priorities set by the presidency - in - office for the western balkans . 
to this end we have set two aims ; the first is to develop regional cooperation , and the second is to implement a genuine policy to encourage a rapprochement between these countries and the european union . 
at cologne , the european council offered countries the opportunity to join the european union . 
at feira , the council considered those countries participating in the stabilisation and association process as potential applicants for membership of the european union . 
we intend to confirm the offer at the zagreb summit , but also go one step further and define the measures each country needs to take and the reforms they need to put in place to this end. lastly , we intend to confirm that the process will receive community support of the highest order . 
on the initiative of france , for the first time the zagreb summit will gather together heads of state and government of the european union and the countries of the western balkans that are participating in the stabilisation and association process : albania , bosnia - herzegovina , croatia , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
this summit will provide an opportunity to draw conclusions at the highest level , with regard to the decisive democratic changes that have taken place in this region . as a result of this , we will be able to reaffirm the fact that the way is open for a rapprochement between all of the countries in the region and the european union , within the framework of the stabilisation and association process . 
the summit will also aim to consolidate democracy in the fry , support the process of reconciliation between these countries and neighbouring countries , and encourage the development of reliable cooperation between the countries in the region . 
therefore , the union , without waiting for the stabilisation and association agreements to be implemented , will remind the five countries concerned that it expects them , as of now , to conclude regional cooperation agreements between themselves . 
such agreements , that were provided for within the framework of the stabilisation and association agreements , should , in our view , include the initiation of political dialogue , a regional free trade area , as well as close collaboration in the field of justice and home affairs , in particular with a view to strengthening the judiciary and its independence in the fight against organised crime , corruption , money laundering and all other forms of criminal trafficking . 
any rapprochement with the european union is , in fact , closely linked , in the eyes of the council , to the development of regional cooperation . 
examination of the reports by mr westendorp y cabeza and mr lagendijk on proposals for a regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand , and the european agency for reconstruction on the other , provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the union intends to give the western balkans in relation to the stabilisation and association process . 
both reports are along the right lines . 
the presidency - in - office , like you , would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid : fewer procedures , greater coordination out in the field , fewer outstanding commitments . 
similarly , we support the extension to the federal republic of yugoslavia of the activity of the european agency for reconstruction , which proved its effectiveness in kosovo . 
we would like to see the programmes assigned to it by the commission implemented more efficiently and speedily . 
the council presidency aims to reach an agreement on the proposals for a regulation regarding the cards programme and the european agency for reconstruction during the general affairs council at the end of november , in other words next week , so as to be able to make an announcement at zagreb on 24 november . 
i should like to remind you that the main priorities of the cards programme are the strengthening of institutions with regard to democracy and the rule of law , economic development and reconstruction , and regional cooperation . 
the cards programme should therefore improve the cohesiveness , effectiveness and visibility of the assistance provided by the european union to the region . 
at the budget council on 20 july , the member states unanimously decided to refocus the debate on the total amount of the financial envelope set aside for cards for the period 2000 - 2006 within the context of respect for the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspective , as determined by the european council in berlin . 
this amount , which will include assistance for the federal republic of yugoslavia , will result from a unanimous decision regarding the way in which the eur 10 billion available under the ceiling of heading 4 will be distributed between the two aid programmes , meda ii and cards , the adoption of which will feature among our priorities . 
lastly , during the general affairs council on 18 september , the presidency - in - office adopted asymmetric commercial preferences for the benefit of those countries that are participating in the stabilisation and association process . 
these measures accord preferential access to the community market for agricultural and industrial products produced by these countries . 
by adopting these measures , the european union has performed an exceptional gesture , as this process of liberalisation , in particular as regards agricultural products , has been offered practically without conditions or rights . 
such measures entered into force on 1 november and the council is currently working to extend them to the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
the french presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the western balkans which are close to being achieved : the development of the stabilisation and association process , the adoption of the cards programme , the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences , to mention but the more noteworthy community measures . 
the long - awaited victory of democracy in croatia , and then in the federal republic of yugoslavia , forces the european union , as we are well aware , to take things much further . 
this is why we must deliver a very strong political message at the zagreb summit , one that is in line with the high hopes for peace and reconciliation that the peoples of the countries in the region have placed in this democratic change . 
the european union must not be afraid to say to these countries : yes , your place , your future is within the european family . 
mr president , my initial impression of president kostunica is that he has been very pragmatic in his political dealings since he assumed power in the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
he has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region . 
he has already visited sarajevo , he has attended an informal regional meeting in skopje and he has also been to moscow . 
the european union was right to react positively to president kostunica 's accession to power . 
visa restrictions have been loosened and the oil and flight embargo has now been lifted . 
the fact that the commission has allocated eur 200 million in emergency and assistance support from the ngos is to be commended . 
it is very important to assure the other balkan participants that the return of yugoslavia to the international community will in no way lessen their support from the european union . 
due attention must be paid to the sensitivities of all countries in the balkan region and to assure them that they will not be neglected in the general euphoria over president kostunica 's accession to power . 
question no 1 by ( h - 0818 / 00 ) : 
subject : rapid reaction facilitywhy has this proposal not been discussed formally under the french council presidency , although work had certainly begun on this issue under its predecessors ? 
on 10 may , the commission presented a proposal to coreper aimed at setting up a rapid reaction facility with a view to meeting the expectations expressed by heads of state and government at helsinki . 
during the european council , within the framework of the report on the development of european facilities for military and civilian crisis management , it was suggested that rapid financing mechanisms , such as the creation by the commission of a rapid reaction fund , should be set up to speed up the provision of finance to support european union activities , to contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund ngo activities , where appropriate . 
in line with the mandate given by coreper , studies of this project are being carried out by the group of foreign affairs ministers . 
the council seeks to help foster a climate of confidence between the parties involved and ensure that this is achieved . 
now , the issue relates to the self - determination of a nation and the implementation of united nations resolutions . 
whatever the result of the referendu. independence or annexation to morocc. it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively . 
otherwise , the exacerbation of current tensions and the possible return to arms would be dangerous for the region as a whole at a time when we are discussin. and we were even doing so earlier in this chambe. the resumption of the euro - mediterranean partnership . 
how can we even consider reviving this partnership without first resolving the conflict ? 
we are well aware of the close links between the european union and morocco and , in particular , between france and morocco , which is why i wanted to ask mr moscovici if he could inform us as to the content and nature of negotiations that he is currently holding with the moroccan government on the western sahara question . 
question no 5 by ( h - 0826 / 00 ) : 
subject : eu initiatives in dispute between armenia and azerbaijanrecently , following many years of conflict between armenia and azerbaija. which have resulted in devastating economic stagnation and severe damage to the social fabric of the two countrie. there have been signs of reciprocal attempts at rapprochement to break the current deadlock between the two countries and embark on reconstruction . 
according to the international herald tribune of 7 september 2000, the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan , robert kocharian and heydar aliyev respectively , have had at least 11 meetings with each other in recent times . 
the eu has so far remained a passive onlooker in the face of the two countries ' endeavours and has taken no initiative , leaving the field open for other strategic players to make moves in their own interests . 
what diplomatic initiatives will the council take to further the rapprochement between armenia and azerbaijan , settle their bilateral differences , and promote cooperation between the two countries ? 
as you will be aware , the european union supports the mediation efforts currently in progress with a view to finding a political solution to all of the conflicts in the region , on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity of the states concerned and an appropriate degree of autonomy . 
the union is therefore closely monitoring contacts between armenia and azerbaijan with a view to finding a solution to the nagorno - karabakh conflict , which is why it welcomes the meetings that have regularly taken place between the two presidents and hopes that they will lead to a political solution . 
the european union remains convinced that the minsk group of the osce has a central role to play in finding a solution to the nagorno - karabakh conflict , in spite of the fact that the solutions put forward by this group in 1997 and 1998 were both rejected by erevan and baku . 
the european union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries . 
thanks to the various opportunities for cooperation , it has been possible to establish regular political dialogue with the aim of facilitating exchanges between armenia and azerbaijan . 
at the same time , the union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes , in particular its tacis programme . 
it has offered to finance cross - border projects of common interest in an attempt to re - establish good neighbourly relations between the two countries . 
i think that the european texts are intended to encourage each member state to take the necessary measures to ensure that the act of facilitating , directly or indirectly , the unauthorised entry , movement or residence in its territory of an alien who is not a national of a member state of the european union is regarded as an offence . 
i have nothing further to add . 
question no 8 by ( h - 0836 / 00 ) : 
subject : ' crimes of honour ' in turkeyevery year , dozens of women fall victim to ' crimes of honour ' in turkey . 
although turkish law confers the same rights on women as men , in practice many men continue to condemn women to death for being raped , committing adultery or simply for meeting other men . 
the men who commit the murders rarely receive long prison sentences , some get off with as little as two years . 
the new legislation being drafted in turkey , which prohibits reduced sentences , is necessary but it is even more important that muslim leaders officially condemn ' crimes of honour ' , which are a direct violation of islam . 
there is a need both for legislation and measures to stimulate debate and increase awareness . 
what will the council do to encourage turkey to take effective measures to combat ' crimes of honour ' ? 
such practices appear to be in sharp decline and , we are told , only occur sporadically in rural areas . 
however , these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances . 
the turkish government has undertaken significant reforms aimed at fighting such acts more effectively , acts which are , of course , not permitted by national law . 
the report that was adopted by the turkish cabinet on 21 september as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law , such as the inclusion of measures in the civil code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields , ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and , lastly , measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences . 
rest assured that the council will remain particularly vigilant as to the implementation of these measures that are in line with the copenhagen criteria , as discussed at length earlier on . 
that is the political position . 
i shall answer your first point very clearly . 
these bilateral sanctions have demonstrated their scope and limitations . 
they were imposed and then lifted and , in my view , show that we need to submit proposals for the creation of legal mechanism to be provided for in the treaties . 
in this regard , several countries , including austria , have put forward proposals to amend article 7 of the treaty on european union , in order to set up a prevention and warning mechanism which would mean that a country considered to be out of step with the values of the european union can receive recommendations while at the same time having its point of view heard . 
this was the proposal put forward by the austrian government , for example . 
i can assure you that this proposal has been fully considered and , in my view , we should seek to amend the treaty along such lines , within the framework of the igc . 
the president - in - office 's reply that he did not have the specific answer to this question and his general statement that the helsinki conclusions were the common point of reference of both parties certainly did not constitute an answer to the very specific observations made by mr cem in his letter . 
mr president , i am very grateful to the president of the council for such a positive and to some extent optimistic and encouraging answer . 
it must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement ; as he knows , if this agreement were not reached , bearing in mind its significance , this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the european union and morocco . 
i should like to ask him if in the coming weeks the french presidency is going to push for this agreement to be concluded at last . 
mr president - in - office of the council , it is essential that the french presidency should push hard along this home straight because commissioner fischler lacks the mediterranean imagination needed to be able to secure an agreement . 
he is less likely to succeed in something which is purely mediterranean , than pitres , a village up in the alpujarra mountains in granada , is in getting its own port , or even the expansion of its port . 
this is what we shall endeavour to do and it is along these lines that we intend to proceed and no other . 
mr president , i am going to ask a question , do not worry . 
anyway , allow me to say that mr fischler is neither mediterranean nor is he from the atlantic , and what is more we are unfortunate enough to have a director - general for fisheries who is from the north atlantic and only learnt about fisheries problems when he was recently appointed to that post . 
thus the question i ask the minister is as follows : the proposal we know about from morocco would in principle seem to entail cutting the fleet from galicia , andalusia , the canaries , and also portugal , that fishes in moroccan waters , down to 25 % at least . 
the agreement they propose is for two years instead of five , and in addition they want the european union to pay them the esp 21 billion that it is currently paying . 
allow me to say that the political will shown in practic. not in theor. by the community negotiators has been absolutely nil , or in any case inadequate . 
i must therefore express my scepticism about the result . 
mr president , it is not the place of the council to comment on behaviour observed on the territory of any member state which contravenes the principles enunciated in the european convention on human rights which each member state has duly signed and ratified . 
it is worth pointing out that the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions , in accordance with the conclusions of the tampere european council , must make it possible to reinforce cooperation between member states while at the same time reinforcing the protection of human rights . 
the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions presupposes the reciprocal confidence of member states in their own criminal justice systems . 
this confidence will depend specifically on setting minimum standards , especially in terms of procedure , which will have to be adopted as a precondition for the implementation of mutual recognition . 
the european union member states have a shared commitment to the principles of freedom , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the rule of law . 
these are citizens from scotland where after 110 days of detention any person charged with an offence must either be brought to trial or released and never again charged with that offence . 
we do not have common standards of justice in the european union and while we have such divergent standards and such total failure to meet the standards of article 6 of the convention on human rights , it is unacceptable to press ahead with the proposals of the council . 
. ( fr ) yes , i simply wanted to say that it is precisely because we are sensitive to this issue that a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions is possible . 
that is what is at issue here . 
mr president , my point of order is that there remain twenty minutes of question time , there are very few members in the house and there is no risk of exceeding time . 
i ask you to give a ruling that two supplementaries may be allowed . 
supplementary questions must come from other members . 
according to the rules of procedure , you have reformulated your question . 
question no 14 by ( h - 0855 / 00 ) : 
what steps will the council take to stop the adoption of this us bill , which is in breach of international trade rules , and what action will it take to secure the total lifting of the embargo on cuba and the restoration of normal trade relations between cuba and all other countries , in particular the member states of the european union ? 
however , it must be regretfully pointed out that the us government has not yet taken any action regarding its own commitments under the agreement concluded at the london summit in may 1998 . 
we call on the us government to do so , as we believe this is essential in resolving this dispute . 
the objective of the european union regarding cuba , as established in the common position on cuba adopted by the council on 2 december 1996, is to encourage a process of peaceful " transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the cuban people " . 
you , of course , suspect that i do not agree with that view ; be that as it may , i consider that this sort of judgment constitutes interference in the internal affairs of a country . 
and , the way in which you phrased your position gives me cause to wonder if , in the final analysis , there is any difference between the ultimate aim of the policy of the european union on cuba and the ultimate aim of american policy on cuba . 
it seems to me that both seek to overturn the socialist regime in cuba . 
it is curious what interpreting problems there can be , as i do not feel that is what i said at all . 
regarding the incident involving the greek and turkish aircraft taking part in the destined glory exercise , it must be pointed out that this incident took place during a nato exercise between two members of the north atlantic alliance . 
it is therefore up to nato to take the steps it deems necessary to prevent further accidents of this kind . 
this case has not , in any case , been brought up in the council of the european union . 
on the substance of the disputes between turkey and greece in the aegean sea , the council recalls the conclusions of the helsinki european council which stress the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the united nations charter and which insistently call on applicant countries to make every effort to settle any border disputes and any other disputes of a similar nature . 
failing that , they should take their disputes to the court of justice within a reasonable period . 
by the end of 2004 at the latest , the european council will take stock of the situation regarding any outstanding disputes , especially with regard to their implications for the accession process and so as to promote their settlement through the international court of justice . 
i must inform you , ladies and gentleme. even though there are very few of you i am going to make this solemn statemen. that for the first time in the legislature we have had time to get through all the questions . 
that concludes questions to the council . 
aid for reconstruction ( continuation ) 
the next item is the continuation of the joint debate on aid for reconstruction . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the commission should start by applying the feira conclusions to its proposals . 
plus , and this is unprecedented , it has requested a reduction in wage costs . 
i therefore propose , that not only should we leave these people in peace to get on with their job with the gusto and enthusiasm which they have shown so far , not only should we refrain from upsetting the modus operandi of the agency , although we should , of course , make it responsible for the federal republic of yugoslavia and anywhere else it is needed , but we should also ask them to pass their know - how on to other committees whose work , as we all know , is so abysmal , so inefficient and brings in such poor results . 
i trust that we can use these opinions to do more for this region in which hardship and suffering abound . 
commissioner and the few honourable members who have found their way here , i must , of course , start by congratulating the rapporteurs on their work and excellent cooperation , especially the rapporteur who is here in the house . 
the previous speaker spoke of a sort of marshall plan for this region and rightly so , i think . 
any such changes must be set out in an agreement . 
fourthly , and most importantly for us , new borders are being erected but they are no obstacle to the activities of criminal organisations , which know no borders . 
we must combat illegal cross - border activities , be they in connection with the drug trade , cross - border cooperation or trafficking in human beings . 
borders are there to be dismantled , but not by criminals and , unfortunately , they are more active here than in other regions . 
these are the objectives we need to achieve with the funds and instruments which we are now creating . 
we must admit that , on numerous occasions , the individuals serving a number of purposes during the transitional phase were not a healthy expression of political life in the region . 
in this sense , we need to review our perception of individuals , facts and situations . 
the second issue which i would like to touch on concerns the strategy in the region . 
quite clearly , uniting political prospects with economic and institutional prospects is a positive development . 
however , if positive developments are to have good results , they need a strategic framework and a strategic aspect . 
from this point of view , i think that resurrecting an issue which was resolved about a year ago with the pack report as far as the headquarters of the reconstruction agency is concerned is a disservice . 
it would be a good idea for commissioner patten , who has a great deal of experienc. not to say wisdo. in managing international crises , to add to the visits which he has made to various regions of the balkans by going to the headquarters of the reconstruction agency in thessaloniki in order to see how this department works . 
in this sense , i endorse and repeat everything which mr folias just said . 
anyway , enough of the bad news , now to the good news . 
the lagendijk report , apart from the criticism which i may have levied at one point , is an excellent text , as is the commission proposal . 
they create a framework for political initiatives which must be built up into new perceptions . 
we must look on this region as a region of europe and not as a region of antagonism between the countries and the national policies of europe or america . 
if we treat the area as a region of political antagonism we shall be making a big mistake . 
in all events , i think that we are on the right track . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for the excellent reports which they have tabled today . 
the message sent by parliament through these documents comes across loud and clear . 
it is my hope that the commission and the council will accept it with due interest and amend the two regulations accordingly . 
we are all aware of the importance of european union aid for the balkan region . 
the re - establishment of a democratic political system in serbia is the start of a new chapter in history , but the union must be the protagonist of this new phase rather than the passive , slothful observer which it has been thus far . 
our technical and economic intervention must be large - scale and effective , for this is the very least the union can do to give the region and the continent as a whole a stable future . 
we must bear in mind that there is still a long way to go along the road to peace in the balkans and that potential friction points still exist which could well set the whole process back again . 
but this region , the most troubled region of europe , has never held such hope as it does now . 
the virtually despotic croatian system has been replaced with a pro - west democratic system . 
thank you commissioner . 
the joint debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m . 
asem iii 
mr president , let me engage in a bit of continent hopping . 
where it has done so most successfully , it has managed it by combining economic and political reform . 
that has been the background to these summits . 
the challenge for the third summit in seoul was to deepen the asem process both for governmental participants and for the broader public . 
it had to demonstrate that there need not be dramatic events occurring to justify meetings of european and asian heads of state or government . 
we outlined our goals for asem iii in our working party , we discussed it with the european parliament before the summit on two occasions in the asean working party and in the plenary which resulted , i believe , in your resolution of 5 october , the aims of which we not only took into account , but also managed to achieve in most cases . 
in addition to adopting three important documents , the leaders of the summit actively engaged in discussion of sensitive issues like human rights , the south china sea , east timor and burma . 
they pledged to promote and protect fundamental human rights and uphold respect for democracy , the rule of law , equality , justice and concern for the environment . 
it was agreed to intensify asem 's high level political dialogue by drawing strength from the diversity of members while not excluding any issue . 
the summit adopted the separate seoul declaration for peace on the korean peninsula , welcoming the inter - korean summit in june , urging both sides to continue building on its success and underlining the importance of engaging the democratic people 's republic of korea in multilateral dialogue . 
on enlargement , the two - key approach was adopted whereby a candidate country first needs the support of its regional partners before seeking endorsement from the other region . 
the final decision is made by consensus , by heads of state or government . 
no specific candidates were discussed at asem iii . 
in the field of economic and financial cooperation , leaders agreed to work together to address the challenges posed by globalisation , information technology , e - commerce and the digital divide by expanding research and information networks between the two regions . 
leaders also confirmed the preparation of voluntary annual reports on the status of efforts to overcome barriers to trade as identified under the trade facilitation action plan . 
there was an acceptance by all asem partners to work towards a new comprehensive wto round as soon as possible , taking into account the special needs of developing countries . 
in the social and cultural field , leaders recognised the vital importance of better educational links with specific initiatives for promoting mutual awareness , including an enhancement of inter - university cooperation and electronic networking between schools . 
in the related people - to - people field , the principle of opening the asem process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained , although the ngo initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain asian partners . 
i am sure parliament can see these results are in line with the resolution of 5 october which i mentioned earlier . 
human rights and the rule of law are embedded in the process ; there was a clear understanding of the need for the early start of a broad - based wto round but i am not sure that has been entirely reflected so far at the discussions at the apec meetings in brunei . 
while the proposal to establish a social forum was not accepted , we actively engaged with civil society and the ngos and i very much hope that this area will see further progress in the run - up to asem iv in copenhagen . 
finally , leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework . 
inevitably , asem iii was dominated by the momentous developments on the korean peninsula which have resulted in the very worthy nomination for the nobel peace prize of the president of south korea , a man whose career has been distinguished , both by his commitment to democracy and human rights and the rule of law and , most recently , to his commitment to reconciliation between the south and north of the peninsula . 
i think that reminded us in europe of the important role that we have in asia , not just in economic and trade terms , though it has to be said that one of the reasons for asia 's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to asian exports over the last two years . 
i only wish that both this house and many of your colleagues in the commission would see the importance of asia 's relations with europe from the right perspective , and that includes the union 's fisheries polic. may my spanish colleagues forgive me and with my excuses to mr fischler . 
if you take a long - term view of political and economic developments in our multi - polar world , then you will see that asia 's relations with europe , and vice versa , are of paramount importance . 
it is when you look at cooperation between asia and europe from the point of view of democracy or human rights that you see how important it is for us to cooperate more closely with parliaments in the asian countries and bring about positive developments . 
mr jarzembowski , with regard to your remark about the extremely low attendance , if we count the commissioner , we can say that 75 percent of the speakers are present . 
the monitoring of fisheries affects the jurisdiction of the member states and hence to a certain extent the core of their sovereignty . 
this monitoring should be transferred to an unequivocally community body , so that the common fisheries policy can apply to all member states and to all vessels and crews regardless of their nationality , thus avoiding any possible breach of the principle of equal treatment . 
the administration of monitoring and , progressively , its actual execution must therefore be assigned to the commission , and hence the cost of this must be borne by the community budget . 
the existing machinery for transposing rules into community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current sluggishness . 
similarly , if the community is a contracting party in the rfos , it must behave accordingly and perform the role required of it . 
the implementation of this principle has financial implications and requires legal changes and , possibly , sacrificing a certain amount of sovereignty ; but if a particular model of political integration is chosen the means must be provided for that model to be put into practice . 
i have been an observer in some regional organisations and i can assure you that it is pathetic to see two or three mid - ranking officials , exhausted and hardly getting any sleep , trying to react to problems that could be seen coming months earlier and facing high - powered delegations , which are high - powered either because they are from great powers like the united states or japan or because they have followed an intelligent policy of forming alliances in advance . 
as the directorate - general for fisheries is currently being restructured and may gain more staff and better resources , i believe we should demand that priority be given to strengthening this area . 
it would mean , first of all , not having to confine itself to reacting to actions like that of the galapagos agreement and its manifest intention of unilaterally extending the jurisdictional waters of four countries in defiance of the basic norms of international maritime law , or against attempts to arbitrarily expel community fleets , which are among the few that are governed by strict standards and regulations . 
similarly , the commission has the obligation not only to properly represent us in the international maritime sphere but also to take the initiative . 
it should thus promote the setting - up of new regional organisations , beginning where the community already has a presence , such as in the western pacific and south pacific . 
in view of the expected restructuring , i should like to ask specifically for a unit to be set up for large migratory species , the need for which has already been noted by the commission insofar as it has drawn up a number of regulations just for these species , which are the main target for flags of convenience , a pirate scourge that inexplicably is spreading ever more widely . 
mr president , i thank the rapporteur and the commissioner . 
the regional fisheries organisations and the community 's participation in them is an important issue . 
covering nearly all the high seas these organisations provide an instrument to ensure active conservation and management of the fisheries resource . 
it is this precious resource that i should like to turn to . 
we face a depletion of stocks already which puts fishing into a crisis situation . 
there is over - fishing , pollution of our seas , the climate is changin. we see that at the conference at the hague at the momen. and the physical alteration of the environment puts increasing pressure on these finite resources . 
reform of the cfp will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important . 
in scotland the scottish fishermen 's federation and the world wildlife fund have got together to propose the concept of zonal regional management . 
the fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region . 
although initially merely advisory in its recommendations , it is hoped that by illustrating efficiency and effectiveness over time it would earn a management role . 
the development of a regionalisation of the cfp will be critical in ensuring local action . 
we are backing the regional fisheries organisations ; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the commission to have more weight in them . 
when we say more organisations , we mean those that can and should be set up in the south atlantic or south pacifi. as has already been said her. and for the commission to take a leading role in them . 
i believe the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations , and the commission must make every possible effort , commissioner , to this end. to support the united nations position in both the 1982 convention and the new york one , which has been mentioned here , we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing . 
we are a budgetary authority and i believe we should fund this line , because in these organisations and in these waters we are staking a lot on the future of fisheries in the coming years . 
i want , therefore , to stress that the opinion of parliament is practically unanimous , and so the commission should realise that we are allies in this constructive endeavour to give the commission greater weigh. more staff , as we have said . 
in comparison with other nations the european union representation is clearly small , so we have to have more and better representation , mr fischler . 
let me say that we are going to continue this strategy of calling you before our committee in advance to inform us of the positions that you intend to advocate . 
we shall do so together with the fishing sector so that we can form a common , joint opinion then you will have to return to the parliamentary committee for the commission to report back to us . 
i should like to close , mr president , by once again congratulating our rapporteur , mr jové , for the magnificent report he has drawn up . 
could i first of all take the opportunity to welcome the report and say that the whole issue of the management , control and the conservation of fisheries stocks is a major problem no matter where you look . 
throughout the european union and far beyond we are all well aware of that . 
it has also been the source of tremendous disagreement between the fishermen , on one hand , and the scientists , on the other . 
to some extent , those of us who are politicians find ourselves in the middle . 
we are neither fishermen nor scientists and we try to find the way and the truth between what both are saying to us . 
this is an extremely difficult position to have to try to find a way through . 
what i would say to this house and to the commissioner is that we need information of the highest quality and the highest standard that we can all , scientists , fishermen or politicians , take on board . 
that is why i believe there is a tremendous role for the commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to . 
the commission should take account of the views of the national regional authorities and the industry . 
the commissioner , when he replied to my report last month , seemed to get his geographical situations slightly mixed u. he did not know whether he was going to scotland , ireland or northern ireland . 
i suddenly discovered that he went to scotland and the republic of ireland but he did not come to northern ireland . 
hopefully , geographically , he will be much better placed in the future . 
i know he knows where northern ireland is and i certainly hope he will come in the future to visit the fishermen there . 
i want to say , before we come to a decision that will end the chao. because i think we are all aware of the situation we are facing coming into december on tacs and quota. that it is going to be extremely difficult not only for the regional and national areas and the fishermen but also for the commission . 
we need a better way of addressing this at a better time of the year with a greater lead in and greater cooperation than we have had in the past . 
it is in fact the member state. in keeping with the basic structure of the european unio. which are primarily responsible for controls . 
in exercising their sovereign rights as flag states , they must provide the necessary human , financial and material resources needed in order for the community to meet its international obligations . 
the commission therefore stands by its conclusion in the communication that , as far as controls are concerned , nafo is an exceptional case and should not become the rule . 
if we want to consider a completely new take on the commission 's remit in relation to controls inside and outside community waters , then i think that it we should do so in connection with preparations to reform the common fisheries policy . 
mr president , the commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the european union is subject to cyclical movements , with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet . 
the periods of crisis are becoming worse and worse . 
the last one caused prices to fall by over 30 % from mid - 1998 to early 2000 . 
the result is the disappearance of family holdings , whose only solution is to close down or to move into what is known as integrated production , in other words production in which the producers lose their independence as farmers and join a business structur. such as distribution chains or supermarket. which dictates production plans to them in exchange for a certain economic stability . 
we have sometimes even wondered to what extent the cyclical market crisis itself may not be caused by the speculative action of these business structures , which thus gradually take control of the sector for their own interests . 
the commission accepts that the only two ways to support the marke. private storage and refund. are insufficient to stave off the crisis , and yet it makes this timid and ineffectual proposal . 
its lack of imagination and lack of ambition are amazing . 
rather than a measure to guarantee producers ' incomes when prices collapse , it is more like a paternalistic piece of advice : save up in times of plenty so you can get by in times of shortage . 
what the proposal calls a regulatory mechanism consists of authorising a member state that so wishes to establish a fund financed by those producers who join it on a voluntary basis for a minimum of five years , on the undertaking that they do not increase their stock . 
the contribution from the community budget is nil , and the commission confines itself to authorising the levy thresholds and the fund payments from within the management committee . 
the voluntary nature of the system means that the task of controlling production will be borne by only a few while the rest nullify this effect by producing without limit until the next crisis arrives . 
reference is also made to the need to encourage producer organisations , the prevalence of which varies greatly from one member state to another . 
for the socialists the amendments approved by the committee on agriculture provide an acceptable framework for the establishment of the proposed funds , and therefore if the commission is not willing to accept these amendments , we ask it to withdraw its proposal , which in its present form has been rejected both by ourselves and by the sector . 
the report has been resisted and rejected . 
some of the demands go beyond the report because there is much which is out of kilter in the beef and pigmeat sectors . 
on the one hand , the largest producers , or those integrated with processing industries downstream , would distance themselves from this measure , preferring the systems they already have : individual savings ; bank loans and redistribution funds . 
they would not have to commit themselves to limiting output and would retain their right to expand . 
they would hence be the very source of the next overproduction crisis which would inevitable lead to the bankruptcy of the regulatory funds . 
on the other hand , the more modest producers , family farms , would play the game of solidarity , accept to limit their output and contribute to a national regulatory fund which would drive them into bankruptcy when the next overproduction crisis occurred . 
the current com in pigmeat is extremely flimsy and much too hesitant . 
this planned reform is the first remotely significant reform that the commission has proposed since 1975 . 
the amendments introduced by the committee on agriculture and rural development at the instigation of georges garot , whom i must congratulate on his work , transforms this limited text into a wide - ranging one . 
the changes made by the committee are major indeed . 
the participation of all member states in this new system will be compulsory . 
producers from all over the european union will be able to subscribe to this measure . 
the participation of the community budget is also essential since , without it , those joining one of these regulatory funds would simply be faced with constraints and the system would not be attractive at all . 
efforts cannot be made by producers alone . 
that is why our rapporteur proposes that the european union should make a greater commitment by co - financing the regulatory funds . 
in this way , far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice , with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving , at reasonable cost , towards what is practised in certain third countries , such as the insurance - cum - income systems in force in the united states and canada . 
we therefore support the proposal by the commission , as profoundly amended by the work of the committee on agriculture and rural development , and will be voting in favour of the garot report . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin straight away by saying that , in principle , i welcome the commission 's proposal to set up a compensation fund , even from the point of view of austrian agriculture . 
this fund may be just the instrument to reduce pigfarmers ' losses in times of crisis . 
the community could be providing funds in a mainly technical sense , financing technical matters in connection with start - up , and thus supporting actual start - up . 
to be perfectly honest , i do not believe in his particular brand of medicine , and i will tell you for why . 
i would sooner strengthen groupings , specifically with a view to gaining a better market position and making better agreements . 
i cannot therefore support the idea of putting all the market 's eggs in an anti - cyclical price policy basket . 
the second important question is the voluntary basis for the system . 
the commission proposal gives member states the choice of whether or not they wish to set up a fund , whereas the proposed amendment makes it compulsory for all member states . 
but we must not forget that european pigfarming varies and is organised differently from one country to another and that cooperation between the individual stages of the production chain is organised very differently . 
as a result , there is a whole series of member states , and of pigfarmers in those member states , who will brook no discussion of a compensation fund because they say that they do not need it because they have other arrangements for coping with recessions in their income cycle . 
other countries are determined to have a compensation fund and i will tell you quite frankly that , if we were to propose a mandatory compensation fund , we might as well forget the whole idea , because it would never obtain a majority in the council . 
then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system , as stated in proposed amendments nos 7 and 13 . 
i think this is asking for trouble because a ) breeding is a very varied operation and b ) support for breeders will not necessarily automatically fall in the same phase of the cycle as support for fatteners . 
plus , the weight of piglets various enormously , from 8 to 30 kg , and there is , as it were , no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets , meaning that there is no basis on which to support them . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the reality as described in the annual report is , however , more sobering . 
what is particularly regrettable and almost incomprehensible is that there are still problems about the reliability of accounting procedures . 
in other words , the commission has not put its books in order , and the closures only reflect the true financial position subject to serious limitations . 
information is missing on the payment of advances and the payment of instalments at the year end , and existing commitments are , believe it or not , undervalued by eur 2.6 million . 
at the same time , the court of auditors says that potential claims have been significantly overvalued . 
parliament expressly drew attention to these serious accounting errors during the discharge procedures for 1996, 1997 and 1998 . 
even if it is difficult and time consuming to fundamentally change budget management , we might have hoped , commissioner , that the new commission would at least manage to get the books straight without delay . 
but it is apparent that they have not even succeeded in doing that , which is a matter of great regret as far as i am concerned . 
when you assumed office , mrs schreyer , you assured us that you would strive to achieve this . 
the european parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year , in january , it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors . 
you are familiar with the wording of that decision . 
but if there is no closure , that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management , just as we said back in january . 
closure is a condition for such a discharge . 
a solution needs to be found here , and i would like to ask you , mrs schreyer , if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged . 
once again , and for the sixth successive time now , the court is unable to give a positive statement of assurance , that is to say , it cannot give a guarantee of the legality and regularity of the procedures on which the financial statement is based . 
the number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given . 
the error rate is still well over 5 % . 
expressed in euros , that means that a sum of approximately eur 5 billion was spent incorrectly . 
i most certainly recognise that fraud is not always involved , mr karlsson . 
the amount of fixed assets has been set eur 240 million too low . 
liabilities have been set eur 2.6 billion too low , and unredeemed liabilities have been set eur 1.2 billion too high . 
if this can be done in an hour by an able employee here in parliament , then we can probably also demand that the court of auditors issue a report of this kind on all sections . 
some unpalatable facts will emerge of course but , at the same time , we are demonstrating that transparency exists . 
in that way , we can shut the press up , which is merciless and scents blood every year when the court of auditors produces its report . 
once and for all , we can say : ' here are the problem areas , and we want to find solutions ' . 
i believe this is a good way of doing that , and i also think that the report should be much more practical . 
i should also have liked the court of auditors ' report to have been a little more user - friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations , for example one or two per chapter . 
i could also do with seeing the court of auditors produce its report earlier in the year . 
only very few cases have been referred to olaf and for criminal investigation in the member states , but it is important to remember that , as mrs theato also mentioned , 7 % of the budget corresponds to dkk 5 to 6 billion . 
reform of the commission is largely about making the individual directorates - general responsible , and i should like to ask the court whether it has plans in future to restructure the annual report so that chapters for the individual directorates - general are prepared . 
i shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can make a start on assessing the directorates - general . 
we can also make a start on assessing the commissioners and giving them marks according to how good they are . 
they could perhaps be given a push in the right direction , if need be . 
the court of auditors emphasises once again that daily administration of most eu resources , for example within agriculture and the structural sphere , takes place in the member states , and i completely agree with what has been said to the effect that the member states now need to make sure they get their act together . 
the member states avoid responsibility , misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and , every time criticisms are made , a storm of criticism rains down upon those in brussels , that is to say the commission and others . 
of course , we all know that the commission is working on its programme of reform . 
there is also indeed a need for action in the regional and national parliaments , because it is the member states themselves that are responsible for a great many errors . 
madam president , i , along with all my colleagues , wish to welcome this annual report which is presented to us in a spirit of constructiveness . 
the commission and the member states should see it in this light and use the findings of this report as a tool for improving their performance in managing the eu 's finances . 
it is regrettable that it is not possible for the court of auditors to give a clean bill of health to the commission with a positive statement of assurance . 
this situation has not changed since the first statement of assurance was published in respect of the 1994 budgetary year . 
member states are responsible for managing 80 % of the expenditure and a range of errors has been found by the court at member state level . 
this is somewhat disquieting . 
we should remind ourselves that the eu resources come directly or indirectly from european citizens . 
there is , therefore , a clear duty to account for every last euro of expenditure . 
we must ensure that the european citizens receive value for money . 
i am pleased that the commission has taken steps to improve its management control over community finances , and systems are being put in place in the member states . 
this will diminish the level of errors . 
the commission must be vigilant in its pursuit of proper management procedures at member state level . 
we in parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the commission carries out this task . 
the commission has responsibility for implementing the budget . 
proper management and control procedures , lack of planning , inadequate evaluations , loose or non - existent eligibility criteria frequently feature in this report . 
this , combined with the negative statement of assurance , makes some worrying reading for the taxpayer . 
i know that this report and the work that parliament is about to embark on in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance when it comes to community spending . 
therefore , may i suggest that in the next debate on the presentation of the accounts , the council should be present and intervene . 
i repeat that the part of the report i most value is the recognition that the commission is getting moving ; but the same cannot be said about the council , whose importance lies not only in the spending figures . 
but i find that the work of the court of auditors has not been done sufficiently well to help us to do our job . 
let us not forget , and i hope the council once again is listening , that 80 % of the money is spent in the member states . 
the court , as in other years , has failed to point out exactly where those failures occurred . 
we have asked time and time again for a ' sinners list ' . 
we want to know where the problems lie , in which member states , in which areas . 
we even want to know about good practice . 
you will note from one part of the report that two member states have been exemplary in terms of vat collection but how are other member states supposed to copy these member states if they do not know who they are . 
we need names . 
if you the court will not do your job of naming and shaming , then we will have to do it for you . 
but your legitimacy as an auditing body will be questioned , and some might even suggest that some members of the court are keen to protect the interests of member states that nominated them . 
will you make a commitment to do this in future , mr karlsson , because a lack of clear information in the report makes it very difficult for us to put pressure in the right areas on the worst offenders . 
we cannot start treating them as fully - fledged members soon enough in this respect . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we recently reached an agreement with the court of auditors under which we would be able to obtain advance information from the court 's annual report on a totally confidential basis , and we also agreed that we would be discreet about this . 
i am saddened to see that the members of the court of auditors do not apparently respect this kind of agreement . 
so my question is whether we should repeat an arrangement of this kind in the coming years . 
i really think that you should have some concerns about the culture on your side , if the court of auditors is not capable of keeping its side of the bargain on such issues . 
secondly , various honourable members have already mentioned the lack of clarity here . 
i urge you , there really is some scope for improvement in the futur. otherwise , your protestations that you want to adopt the right approach in tackling irregularities will merely be empty words . 
mr president , although the court cannot provide a positive statement of assurance for 1999, the tone of the report on the whole is more positive than it has been in previous years . 
i would like to congratulate the commission , and commissioner schreyer in particular , on the court 's observation that many of the changes it has requested are being implemented or are on the way to being implemented . 
there is particular praise for the reform programme set in motion last year . 
i would also like to pick on the council by asking why it is not moving forward on article 24 of the financial regulation . 
parliament moved very quickly to give its opinion and i hope that council will be able to do the same and adopt its position well before christmas . 
having said that , i was disappointed in the report as the first step in the discharge procedure . 
it is too political in the negative sense of the word . 
it avoids strong criticisms and it does not point any fingers . 
other members have already pointed this out . 
finally , mr karlsson , while we , as a parliament , make all these changes , perhaps you could go and help america count its votes ! 
the error rate in the florida count is clearly still too high . 
perhaps some european union common sense will help sort out the problem and give george bush his rightful place in histor. its dustbin ! 
mr president , commissioner , mr president of the court of auditors , ladies and gentlemen , this new report from the court of auditors which we have just received is of interest to the committee on budgetary control because it makes a number of points concerning the problems of managing the community budget , while at the same time warning us against the narrow interpretations that could be extracted from the crude exploitation of certain figures . 
but in addition to these , mr president , we need more detailed explanations and analyses in order to progress . 
let me quickly expand upon three points . 
first of all , there is a question of terminology : even though all too often no clear distinction is made between the notions of fraud and irregularity , the court of auditors warns us against the temptation to consider irregularities or errors as tantamount to cases of fraud . 
but it must be pointed out that the court of auditors itself says that cases of fraud are few in number . 
this report raises another point : the problems linked to vat . 
vat is an important component of the community budget revenues . 
but it has to be recognised that we are faced with a complex system . 
rates differ from one member state to the next ; their make - up also differs from one member state to the next . 
for example , there is regional vat in some member states . 
we also still need to continue to question the implementing of fiscal harmonisation . 
the third point i would like to make concerns the debate which took place yesterday evening when the court of auditors ' presented its annual report to the committee on budgetary control . 
the court of auditors was aske. and a number of speakers have reminded us of this mornin. to explicitly name the member states in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered . 
i would warn us against the temptation to indulge in such practices . 
we are not looking for scapegoats , either in our institutions or in our member states . 
what is more , as the working method applied by the court of auditors is based on sampling , we only have a partial view of the situation . 
the report from the court of auditors highlights , somewhat more so than in the past , the situation regarding the management and control of community funds by the member states . 
this analysis should lead us , as meps , and the commission to put forward proposals to improve the management and financial control systems which the member states must implement in order to protect the financial interests of the european union . 
in conclusion , i would call for improved cooperation with the council . 
mr president , mr president of the court of auditors , commissioner , over the last two years the court of auditors has published six special reports on the subject of the common agricultural policy . 
in its special report on subsidies for the disposal of skimmed milk , it highlights a lack of supervisory measures , a level of falsification of milk data and fraudulent use of this data that is unparalleled in any other agricultural sector . 
in its report on the disposal of butter , the court of auditors noted that 89 % of the budget is spent on subsidies to the food industry through procedures of dubious transparency and of even more dubious efficiency in terms of their impact on farmers ' incomes . 
in both cases , this involves a limited number of countries and a limited number of economic agents , who are the direct beneficiaries of these policies . 
in what has been its most important work on the common agricultural policy , the special report on arable crops , the court concluded that , from 1993 to 1997, the community budget paid out a sum of more than eur 13 billion more than could reasonably have been expected . 
arable crops represent 43 % of the cap budget , but only 10.7 % of the end product . 
in 1995, almost 40 % of payments went to the top 3 % of beneficiaries , whilst 57 % , the smaller beneficiaries , received only 4.5 % of payments . 
the court , therefore , quite rightly concluded that support for farmers should not be provided on the basis of price , production or area , but of support for the net income of farmers or of agricultural work units . 
these are excellent , high - quality documents , which are a " drop in the ocean " in a common agricultural policy that still gives special treatment to larger farmers at the expense of the smaller ones and to countries and regions at the heart of europe at the expense of peripheral countries and regions . 
perhaps the quality of the proposal is due in part to the fact that the commission consulted over 14 consumer organisations and these pointed out the difficulties there had been in implementing the 1992 directive . 
another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow - up services . 
mr president , in march this year we adopted the directive on cableway installations designed to carry persons . 
if the directive had already been implemented , the accident in austria might not have happened . 
this demonstrates just how important legislation is here , and directives in areas as sensitive as product safety need to be implemented as soon as possible . 
i hope that will happen before 3 may 2002 . 
the proposal on product safety before us today is a general directive relating in particular to those areas not covered by existing directives . 
i would like to thank the commission for adding a very important new point here . i have in mind the presumption of conformity , that is to say that if products comply with european standards they are considered to be safe . 
i believe that this principle is enormously important for consumer protection because it makes it possible to check at any point whether a product complies with standards or not . 
in view of this , amendment no 37, which provides for external certification and for ce declarations to be issued not just by companies , but also by external and impartial agencies , is particularly important for consumer protection , because it would , of course , considerably increase consumers ' confidence in such declarations . 
in the case of amendment no 14 on the publication of standards in the official journal , i naturally have some difficulty with this because the present copyright is with the national standards agencies , who are therefore entitled to royalty payments from the european union . 
in addition , there is the question of what the scope of current standards in europe is and what the scope of european standards would be . 
i therefore have some very considerable reservations and wish to reject this particular provision . 
with regard to export bans , it cannot automatically be assumed that our standards are appropriate throughout the world . 
there are many countries that have their own regulations and safety standards which meet those countries ' needs far better than standards currently in force in europe . 
mr president , commissioner , mrs gonzález álvarez has produced a very convincing report , but my group does not agree with the idea of product liability applying to services as envisaged by the commission . 
for example , in many sectors , products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer , with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers . 
this means that everyone involved in the sales chain who can affect the safety characteristics of a product now bears liability as a manufacturer , so that all dealers who carry out assembly work are classified as manufacturers . 
we believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer 's duties under product safety legislation . 
there are certainly other ways of guaranteeing adequate protection for consumers under civil law , for example , compensation for damages as a consequence of contractual liability . 
i must say that i was amazed that the commission 's experts have not solved this problem themselves and i trust that the new commissioner will give this problem some more thought . 
and i hope that there will not be any problems with the commission as regards exempting charitable organisations and non - profit making bodies from the provisions of this product safety directive . 
when it comes to exports , i quite agree that exports should be banned in cases where the commission has stopped a product from being placed on the market or has ordered a product recall . 
but a commission requirement for safety checks cannot be sufficient grounds for bringing whole branches of the export business to a halt . 
as various honourable members have already said , at the very least proof that different safety rules apply in the importing country should be accepted . 
i can only urge the commission to think again about this problem area , please . 
we are at first reading . 
at second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes , and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen . 
mr president , i join the general congratulations to mrs gonzález álvarez who has been a sympathetic and inclusive rapporteur . 
she may occasionally have found the eccentricities of british car boot sales hard to follow but that , too , came within the remit of her personal charity . 
this directive should be welcomed by the whole house and the issue of general product safety and its extension is something which must be commended . 
in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , under the wise guidance of our rapporteur , we passed a series of amendments which , again , my group would commend en bloc to the house today . 
we are less happy with some of the later ones . 
we have heard the justifications for them and for the reprise of the industrial arguments which we heard in committee . 
we remain unpersuaded and we will vote against most of them . 
perhaps before the vote , mrs lulling or one of her colleagues , will tell us what the exact wording , particularly in the english version , of amendment no 42, is . 
increasingly , as world trade develops , we are faced with this problem and we have to tackle it and not back away on the grounds that somehow the rest of the world does not matter , whether it is the safety of its health , its foodstuffs or the product which we export to it . 
we have to look now at the links between products and services . 
the commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the commissioner will say more about that when he replies . 
finally , i would like to say a word about charity shops and car boot sales and all those other exchanges of donated and individual second - hand goods . 
the charity shops welcome the general protection of this directive . 
but they need an exemption from the obligation under article 2 to provide information that they simply do not have . 
our amendments nos 1, 8 and 18 bear on that point . 
i hope it will be possible for the house to support these because it cannot be anybody 's intention to see these valuable and usually non - profitable charitable activities effectively driven out by an information provision which should relate to mainline manufacturers and to new or well attested products . 
provided the vendor can always inform the buyer of the nature of the goods and the limitations on the information that should be sufficient . 
mr president , it is a fact of life that directives must be evaluated and modified from time to time , and in fact this occurs all too seldom . 
as far as we are concerned , the commission deserves to be complimented on the way it has handled matters on this occasion . 
the procedure it followed was first - rate and also very inclusive . 
this directive gives rise to a certain tension between what can reasonably be expected of producers , on the one hand , and consumer protection on the other . 
in that respect , i would , in a sense , concur with mr lehne when he said that recent statements by the court indicated that this is a rather nebulous area , when it comes to what the union can , and cannot , do . 
in particular , the aspect concerning the definition of exports is something we must look into very closely . 
as matters stand , my group is inclined to support the proposals now on the table , but i would appreciate it if the commissioner could go into this aspect again in a little more depth . 
and this is certainly not the fault of the work carried out by mrs gonzález álvarez , who has endeavoured very successfully to improve the legislation under consideration , but is inherent in both the guidelines and parts of the proposal itself . 
i would have thought it would be better to take more account of subsidiarity . 
a danish or german consumer has different safety requirements to a dutch or italian consumer . 
we must give more consideration to this diversity in the directive on general product safety . 
furthermore , i feel there is insufficient reason for the commission to produce proposals on the safety of services . 
by its very nature , the service industry is less suited to this approach . 
a producer can take a product back , but it would , of course , be rather difficult for a service provider to do so with a service . 
i welcome the fact that exceptions have been made for shops associated with charitable institutions and non - profit organisations , as well as for articles sold as second - hand goods at markets or car boot sales . 
finally , i was wondering whether , on closer inspection , amendment no 14, tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , has been formulated correctly . 
it does not seem to me to be a problem if an agreement is reached between a standardisation body and the government , which makes european standards freely accessible to the public . after all , that is not the same as the commission publishing the european standards . 
i would be interested to hear what the commissioner has to say about this . 
well done mother europe ! 
thank you mother europe for taking care of your children ! 
community standardisation must be based on appropriate scientific knowledge and we must therefore foster cooperation between member states in researching the safety of products in general and of high - risk groups in particular , such as children , the elderly , new youth cultures , new lifestyles and people with a history of illness . 
the reliability of product safety and after - sale care represent added value for a " made in europe " label at a particularly difficult and crucial time . 
any measures that increase confidence and mean that european products are manufactured and distributed with respect for workers ' health , for social rights , for the environment , for fair competition and with rigorous safety requirements are to be welcomed . 
any product that does not match up to this standard must be withdrawn and appropriately disposed of , because products that we would not wish for ourselves should not be exported to more disadvantaged countries either . 
i hope that this directive will help to respond , in part , to the european public 's increasing concerns about consumer safety . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there has been a directive on general product safety since 1992 . 
the purpose of the present debate is to review the experience we have gained with the existing directive , to incorporate that experience and to eliminate any shortcomings . 
i rather doubt whether we have adequately achieved that . 
there are certainly complex legal issues here . 
the scope of the directive in relation to the wide variety of national and community product legislation needs to be defined , as that legislation , too , covers the same safety ground . 
we need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways . 
the possibility of having a product 's compliance with regulations certified by an external agency would certainly be very helpful in this case and would ensure a clearer and more logical approach . 
however , it would have been better to have an eu regulation providing for a general european system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in europe . 
in the food sector , for example , there are also numerous rules and regulations which are currently being amended and revised as a result of proposed eu regulations and i think this will help us to reach a high standard of safety . 
in other sectors , this directive has been extended to other fields of application . 
the inclusion of service - related products will lead to dealers and the craft sector increasingly being burdened with obligations which are actually the responsibility of the manufacturer . 
elsewhere , we are calling on the commission to present a proposal on the safety of services , so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now , instead of waiting for the commission 's proposal , since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on . 
i feel that this means there is a fundamental contradiction in the directive 's approach , which we cannot support as it is proposed here . 
mr president , at this time it is certainly nothing new to state that there is a great divide between the citizens and the european union . 
lack of confidence in the possibility of ensuring food safety , for example , is spreading like wildfire and , when all is said and done , obscures the union 's positive work in this sector . 
but we are going to discuss this today . 
in this context , it is therefore important to emphasise the political value of the directive upon which we are about to vote . 
thanks to the commission 's sound proposal , further improved by mrs gonzález álvarez 's work , the text that we are examining today at last brings good news for consumers , to which , moreover , the non - governmental organisations which represent them bear witness . 
the laws on product safety , in particular the safety of those products which have hitherto escaped regulation by the vertical legislation already governing the matter , is being improved , consolidated and made more transparent . 
a great deal of effort has been made to better define the interaction between vertical laws on certain categories of products and this new horizontal directive , so as to definitely achieve a satisfactory result . 
then i would like to stress the importance of the amendments adopted by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , which increase transparency towards the end consumer and apportion responsibility to distributors as well as producers in the event of products deemed dangerous being withdrawn from the market . 
first of all i wish to thank the rapporteur , mrs gonzález álvarez , the draftsmen , mr rübig and mr lehne , and the respective committees for their very comprehensive report on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on general product safety . 
the current commission proposal is in response to the numerous problems related to the health and safety of consumers which have occurred recently . 
although the review and revision of the directive are formally required by the directive itself , this coincides with the reinforced commitment by the commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers . 
the revised directive will be of relevance for food safety for only a limited period of time but it will , in the long term , improve the possibilities for dealing with non - food product safety problems . 
i would only say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal . 
the idea behind the directive is simple : that only safe products are placed on the market . 
this means european products as well as imported products . 
the two key objectives of the general products safety directive are : ensuring a high and consistent level of protection for consumer health and safety throughout europe and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market . 
we had extensive consultations with stakeholder. as the rapporteur has acknowledge. on implementation of the present directive , which brought to light certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct . 
we first clarify the scope of the directive . 
this directive is meant to provide good and consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers . 
it is also meant to fill possible gaps in sectoral legislation , for instance , market surveillance or emergency procedures that are rarely provided for in specific legislation . 
we now also provide for the possibility of opening the system to third countries , in particular to the candidate countries : simplification of procedures for emergency measures at community level so that we can take rapid action following the advice of a regulatory committee . 
we have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at community level . 
another point to which i wish to draw your attention is the question of improved transparency . 
consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening . 
i am very pleased that the report of mrs gonzález álvarez endorses the main principles of the commission proposal . 
many of the proposed amendments of the report are an improvement on the text and can therefore be accepted by the commission . 
allow me to address first the amendments with which the commission cannot agree . 
firstly , amendments nos 1, 8 and 18 propose to exempt second - hand goods sold by charity shops and non - profit organisations , private persons , flea markets and car boot sales , as mr whitehead has said , from the obligation to provide information and documentation on product risk and product origin . 
the obligations of distributors , which have been a part of the directive since 1992, are formulated in a very generic and flexible way . 
the only new requirement is that distributors , within the limits of their respective activities , are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tracing the origin of products . 
this does not imply that distributors should actively inquire about the origin of a product , but just that they should not destroy identification of the product and / or manufacturer and keep trace of any useful information available on the product origin . 
this new requirement does not imply any substantial additional responsibility in the case of these kinds of shops . 
charity shops normally receive , as a gift , single used products which they in turn sell to consumers . 
the nature of their trade is such that they could not be required to play a proactive part in product tracing . 
in addition , the interest in terms of market surveillance of tracing the origin of single second - hand defective products is simply non - existent . 
in conclusion , there is already a lot of flexibility in the requirements of the directive on distributors . 
these requirements can be applied to these kinds of shops in a way compatible with the nature of their activities . 
however , to meet the concerns raised and in order to further clarify the situation we could consider including in the recital dealing with this article a statement that it may prove impossible to provide the competent authorities with information and documentation on the possible risks and origin of the product in the case of isolated used objects donated by private individuals . 
secondly , amendment no 3 proposes a deletion of part of the motivation for having clear conditions in the annex of the directive for the duty of business to inform the authorities about dangers . 
this motivation is needed in order to prevent excessive bureaucracy . 
thirdly , amendment no 4 proposes adding , in a preamble , a requirement that member states draw up factual reports with the cooperation of competent and independent public or private institutions . 
to require member states to engage external institutions for this runs counter to subsidiarity . 
amendments nos 6 and 29 require the commission to consider approaches or submit a proposal relating to the safety of services in amendment no 29 before a specified date . 
the commission is in fact already analysing and considering this issue , but it would go too far against the commission 's right of initiative to introduce this in the directive in such a prescriptive way . 
amendment no 7 proposes certain changes in the references to paragraphs . 
the first part is acceptable to the commission , but it is not common practice in community legal texts to explain the content of articles referred to , as proposed . 
to replace the word " producer " with " supplier " , as proposed in amendment no 11, would create more confusion than clarity , as there is no definition of supplier in the directive . 
the definition of producer already covers suppliers whose activities may affect the safety properties of the product . 
amendment no 13 proposes adding a reference to the precautionary principle in the general obligation for producers to place only safe products on the market . 
the precautionary principle is a general principle of risk management by the competent authorities and cannot be enforced as such as a direct obligation on producers . 
the commission does , however , share the view that the principle is important as a background for the revision of the directive , and a reference to this principle could therefore be made in the first recital of the directive . 
although the idea of publishing a full text of the european standards in the official journal , as proposed in amendments nos 14 and 16, is understandable , it would require fundamental changes in the relationship between the community and the european standardisation organisations , probably implying higher levels of subsidies from the community budget . 
the reason for this is that the standardisation organisations own the standards and that most of them finance part of their activities through the sale of the standards . 
this issue , with implications for most product - related community legislation , cannot , therefore , be dealt with in the context of the current revision of this directive . 
amendment no 19 proposes harmonisation of member states ' monitoring approaches on the basis of guidelines prepared by the commission and the consultative committee . 
although the commission is in favour of cooperation and common principles , the proposed wording runs counter to subsidiarity . 
to require member states to take measures also in cases when business has already taken satisfactory measures to prevent a risk , which would be the consequence of the second part of amendment no 21, is not acceptable . 
this would also run counter to the objective of encouraging business to take proactive measures on its own initiative . 
amendment no 23 proposes the introduction in the directive of provisions on compensation in respect of damage . 
these are civil law aspects , regulated by the directive on product liability , and should not , therefore , be dealt with here . 
a requirement that the product safety network should be established within a specified time - frame is proposed in amendment no 24 . 
although the commission is in favour of quickly establishing a network , this has to be agreed between the member states . 
it is therefore not realistic to set a time - frame . 
the first part of amendment no 27 proposes that only information related to the risks that have been established should be made available to the public . 
this is not acceptable , as consumers should also have a right to obtain information on on - going investigation. provided that this information is not covered by professional secrecy in the manner that i described earlier and drawn narrowly . 
finally , amendment no 28 proposes that the commission should submit a report on the implementation of the directive every second year instead of every three years . 
although the commission has sympathy for this idea , this cannot be done within the current limitations of the resources of the commission . 
the commission cannot agree with most of the additional amendments proposed for the plenary session . 
allow me to explain first the commission 's position on the amendments to which we cannot agree . 
amendments nos 30, 32, 42 and the main part of amendment no 33 propose rewordings of the existing text of the directive which is not subject to revision . 
no problems have been reported to the commission with the existing wordings and the changes would weaken the provisions . 
amendment no 36 proposes that services directly associated with the product should be excluded except when provided by the original producer . 
the discussions in council go in the direction of dealing with the services within the definition of product which is , in fact , acceptable to us . 
amendment no 43 would totally exclude the application of this directive to products regulated by specific legislation . 
this is not acceptable , as these directives often lack provisions on market surveillance , notification systems and so on . 
a possibility of proving that a product conforms to the requirements through external certification is proposed in amendment no 37 . 
such certification can always be used for providing evidence but cannot , in itself , be regarded as foolproof . 
amendment no 38 proposes limiting the time period for emergency decisions to six months which is , in most cases , not sufficient for adopting permanent measures . 
it also proposes an exemption from the export ban when the producer can show that the safety requirements of the receiving state are complied with . 
this is not acceptable as products judged at community level as posing serious risks and requiring rapid intervention should not be exported . 
the amendment also proposes that the possibilities for parties to submit their views on a community measure taken should be without prejudice to domestic remedies . 
as this is not any type of appeal procedure , this seems unnecessary . 
in addition , amendment no 41 proposes that the export ban should not apply when a product has been banned while carrying out further checks . 
this is a period during which there are real dangers of exports taking place . 
to conclude , i wish to thank again mrs gonzález álvarez for the excellent report which can be supported by the commission to a large extent . 
thank you very much , commissioner byrne . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m . 
membership of political groups 
ladies and gentlemen , we have a lot of votes to take , so can i please ask for a little discipline and cooperation ? 
before we proceed to the vote , i wish to inform you that mr claudio martelli of the technical group of independent members has now joined the mixed group , that is he has switched from the technical group to the mixed group . 
mr martelli , normally you can only speak at the end of voting time , but i shall , exceptionally , give you the floor for a few moments . 
there will not , however , be any discussion of this , but you can make a short personal statement . 
mr president , i have been a socialist in italy and in international organisations for 30 years . 
when i was re - elected to this parliament in june 1999, i naturally joined the group of the party of european socialists . 
on 30 june 2000, at the end of a meeting of the bureau , of which i was a member but where a few close colleagues discussed my case , in my absence and without my knowledge , mr barón crespo informed me that i had excluded myself from his group . 
i did not even receive a courtesy reply to my protest . 
you can submit the rest in writing , to mr barón crespo as well . 
mr president , i wish to categorically reject mr martelli 's remarks . 
we have highly qualified people assisting us with our work . 
there was a mistake in the original analysis , and that has been corrected now , but i would be grateful if the rapporteur , mr morillon , could briefly comment on these two points . 
the first one was from mr katiforis about the word nato , and the second question was about whether the present order is correct as shown . 
mr president , regarding the first question , it is quite clearly an error not of translation but of transcription . 
as far as the order is concerned , i leave it to the discretion of the president to decide , and i repeat that i am against all three amendments . 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) explanations of vote 
-- ( el ) the mediterranean has always been , and still is , a particularly sensitive region with serious political , economic and social problems . 
peaceful coexistence , mutually beneficial and balanced cooperation between countries and peoples , with no interference in their internal affairs , and smooth transnational relations have always been the mainstay of any cooperation between its countries . 
the mediterranean countries which do not belong to the åu have to cope with particularly acute problems of economic development and regional inequalities are becoming more and more marked . 
the åu and its member states bear a great deal of the responsibility for this state of affairs . 
the conditions for reinvigorating the barcelona process have not been fully achieved . 
the delays in implementing the agreements can only be partly justified . 
the responsibility is dual , lying with both the governments of the countries of the union and the governments of the mediterranean partners as well . 
without joint action there can be no dynamism , and without dynamism there will not be sufficient drive for development . 
i would like to end by stressing that by far the most effective means of achieving coordination would be a global union strategy for the mediterranean region . 
such a strategy will be able to establish the goals of an excellent partnership ; such a strategy will provide the necessary justification for every initiative and each and every intervention ; such a strategy will allow the partnership to become a vital means not only of ensuring the economic and social development of the mediterranean region but also of enabling europe to assume a stabilising role throughout the area . 
a genuine equal opportunities policy presupposes a different economic and social policy focusing on equal opportunities for men and women to share in prosperity , not an impoverished life , such as a reduction in the retirement age for both sexes to 60 for men and 55 for women , strengthening and upgrading the public and welfare sectors , abolishing the private health sector and abolishing part - time employment . 
-- ( fr ) we voted for this report because it recognises a certain number of principles on gender equality with which , i am sure , we all agree . 
but all the declarations concerning ' equal opportunities for men and women ' are cast in a rather garish light by the european directive authorising night work for women . 
the ban on night work for women was one of those rare areas in which , by protecting women , the social legislation of certain countries was further advanced for female than for male workers . 
on account of the fact that european institutions are incapable of combating the social segregation suffered by women in the areas of employment , salary and professional promotion and are therefore incapable of ' equalising opportunities ' upwards , they ' equalise ' downwards . 
we are against the social regression represented by the authorisation of night work for women . 
the only reason why it is becoming widespread is the desire of companies to make ever greater profits . 
in order to abolish social segregation , night work should be banned for men and women alike , with the sole exception of public services , notably hospitals and transport , where such work is socially useful . in this case , the inconveniences of working at night should be compensated for by a massive reduction in working hours , with protection for pregnant women . 
. ( pt ) although somewhat belatedly , the commission has presented its programme for the community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001 ­ 2005 ) , which differs strikingly from previous programmes and , specifically , from the fourth action programme , which finishes at the end of this year . 
in line with the proposal that has been presented , the aim of the change in methodology is to increase access and opportunities for non - governmental organisations to actively participate and contribute to the project . 
regretfully therefore , i have voted against . 
gonzález álvarez report ( a5 - 0309 / 2000 ) 
mr president , there are several reasons why i voted against the gonzález álvarez report but , in order to keep within the minute allowed for this explanation of vote , i will mention only one . 
a lot of people came to the airport to see me off when i left to come to strasbourg this time , including an elderly pensioner who , sadly , was suffering from a serious physical injury caused by a highly unsafe product on sale in the european union . 
as i left , i said to her , " do not worry : we are going to debate the gonzález álvarez report which deals precisely with product safety " . 
however , i have realised that there is absolutely no provision in this report for a clear obligation for the rapid compensation of victims of dangerous products for their injuries . 
-- my party has serious reservations about community law applying to the sale of consumer products , as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards . 
thus , we are opposed in principle to the original directive and must therefore oppose any extension of it . 
even if this was not so , we would still have serious reservations . 
while this commission proposal on general product safety is styled as a revision of the 92 / 59 / eec directive , with claims that the approach followed in the original directive has not been altered , this does not seem to be entirely the case . 
what particularly disturbs us are the plans revealed by commissioner byrne to develop a network of enforcement authorities to help implement this law . 
having seen proposals for " networks " elsewhere in community initiatives , we see in this the beginnings of something which is altogether unhealth. a unified enforcement system amounting to a european union consumer law enforcement service . 
this to us seems of a general trend where the commission , having saturated member states with its laws , is now taking altogether too keen an interest in enforcement systems , with an eye to direct control of them . 
on this basis alone , my party opposes this measure . 
-- whilst i support this report on general product safety , it is important that we do not go too far . 
it is important that our products are safe , but we should not go over the top with extreme actions . 
people across europe are extremely concerned about the safety of consumer products , and rightly so . 
this report welcomes an improvement in current european law on product safety , but in my view the directive should not be applied to charity shops , a key feature in the british high street . 
it is absurd to think that the average charity shop can provide the authorities with information about product risks and product origin for second - hand goods acquired from the general public . 
let us not forget that it was my labour colleague , mr whitehead , who introduced the amendments exempting charity shops , and we should congratulate him on his achievements . 
the threat to charity shops occurred because it simply was not understood on mainland europe . 
it is now , and the labour amendments offer a guarantee that charity shops will be left untouched and will be exempt from the directive . 
the overall aim of the directive is extremely important in ensuring that there is a consistent and high level of consumer protection , as well as the efficient functioning of the single market . 
i wholeheartedly support the drive for clearly - worded , understandable warnings about possible risks to be put on products where they are on sale . 
clear labelling is the best way of reassuring worried consumers that the goods they buy are safe . 
public confidence in the safety of products we all buy has taken a real knock in recent years following a number of scares , especially in children 's toys . 
only by taking a safety first attitud. and being seen to take a safety first attitud. can public confidence and the safety of our children be restored . 
lagendijk report ( a5 - 0324 / 2000 ) 
mr president , the council quite rightly hoped to rationalise eu aid to the balkan states and to reform the european agency for the reconstruction of kosovo , whose competence could gradually be extended to cover the entire region . 
we fully support this approach and the two proposals for council regulations which would implement it . but we cannot support the amendments tabled by the european parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the commission . 
today , the european agency for reconstruction is administered by a governing board on which the representatives of the member states and the commission each have one vote and on which decisions are adopted by a two - thirds majority . 
the commission is not at all happy about a situation in which it is under constant supervision and complains that the weight of the member states hinders its freedom of action and therefore , in its view , impedes the effectiveness of its assistance . 
the european parliament has rallied to the call of its old friend and has just voted for amendments in its favour . 
amendment no 5 proposes returning the running of the agency to the commission , which would be responsible to the european parliament . 
amendment no 14 weakens the governing board vis - à - vis the commission , by stipulating that its decisions are adopted by simple majority . 
amendment no 10 extends the tasks of the agency , which is now effectively controlled by the commission . 
finally , amendment no 15 gives the commission free rein in determining the rules governing the languages used by the agency , about which we are very concerned . 
we are witnessing the repetition of a classic scenario in which the commission believes it will manage external aid better if it has more powers and more autonomy , and if it is less supervised by the member states . 
that is a mistake which , as we well know , could unfortunately take us down a very dangerous path . 
we are therefore asking that the member states retain the upper hand regarding the management of aid and the agency . 
in this way , they will exercise better control and they will maintain a vital link between european aid and national policies in this sensitive region . 
mr president , both as a member of the european people 's party and as a member of the pensioners ' party in italy , i was very happy to vote for this major report on european union ai. and the management thereo. to albania , croatia , bosnia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo . 
this aid will serve , above all , to help these countries feel that europe exists and is particularly close to peoples who are the victims of war , war which has brought inconvenience and poverty , especially to the elderly and the infirm , who should be among the first to receive assistance . 
-- i welcome this report which seeks to improve the delivery of eu assistance to the federal republic of yugoslavia by simplifying the decision - making procedures and making them more transparent . 
garot report ( a5 - 0305 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the garot report , although there are many gaps and inaccuracies which the pensioners ' party does not support . 
in particular , i would call upon the commission to decide to put forward new , different types of proposals in order to resolve the problems suffered by agriculture and livestock farmers . 
in fact , we cannot continue to assist those farmers who are in need of european union subsidie. and long may they receive the. in the way we have done thus far , for it has achieved nothing but damage . 
the quota system must be entirely abolished ; we must find a different way of assisting agriculture , fisheries and livestock farmers in the european union . 
-- ( sv ) we are not in favour of new subsidies for pig feed and are therefore voting against the report . 
-- ( da ) the danish social democrats have voted against a report designed to introduce aid for pigmeat producers in the eu . 
the commission has proposed introducing an aid scheme for pigmeat producers by establishing equalisation funds in the member states . 
the proposal is unnecessary and harmful because it introduces a new form of aid for a sector which has so far acquitted itself well without aid . 
the crisis in the pig sector has resolved itself through the market economy , and precisely because unnecessary and expensive aid schemes have not been introduced . 
producers are to receive 100 % aid from the fund to reduce their production , and the eu is to co - finance the scheme . 
we need to prevent producers falling victim to the cyclical variation of the market . 
mr president , i am very critical at this time when we have to decide upon relations between the european union and turkey . 
even though i voted for the motion , i would like to emphasise certain points which i feel that we should always bear in mind in this situation . 
firstly , it is not europe which has asked to become part of turkey but turkey which has asked to join europe , and turkey must therefore adapt to and accept the rules which the european union asks it to respect . 
secondly , turkey is no longer alone against greece but alone against the european union . 
greece , which is no longer able to defend its rights and interests within our institutions , must be defended by the entire european union . 
mr president , i voted for the motion and i was pleased to see that an amendment was adopted recognising the genocide of the armenian people . 
we do not want to rub salt into historical wounds , we want to work together to right wrongs , no matter whose name they were committed in . 
-- ( el ) despite its serious shortcomings , the morillon report is clearly an improvement on the commission proposal as far as the partnership between the european union and turkey is concerned . 
there is a positive reference to the loïzidou case and the judgment of the european court of human rights in strasbourg . 
similarly , there is a positive , albeit inadequate reference to the armenian question , in that turkey should have been clearly called on to acknowledge the genocid. the amendments have , of course , done much to correct this . 
similarly , there is a positive reference to the kurdish question and minoritie. which the commission draft accession partnership passes over in silence . 
however , the main drawback and shortcoming of the morillon report is on the issue of greek - turkish relations . 
the european parliament should make it clear to the turkish government that , if it wants to join the european union , it must stop contesting the borders of member states of the european union and must refer any disputes to the international court to be resolved . 
as far as human rights are concerned , however , the report confines itself to ' encouraging the turkish government ' , ' calling ' on it to do better , without european countries ever threatening it , even if only to stop delivering arms . 
what is at stake is not even the acknowledgement of the reality of armenian genocide , since this house has already had occasion to express its views on this , most notably in its resolution of june 1987 . 
what the members of the european parliament asked of turkey in 1987 was to have the courage to open its eyes to the past so as to be able to look to the future . 
the whole of the armenian community and the armenian children who fled into exile at the beginning of the century to the countries of europe are today waiting for justice to be done . 
they want to offer a memorial to their ancestors , the victims of genocide . 
at a time when the last witnesses of exile , the last survivors of the carnage , are quietly passing away , the work and the duty of remembrance are even more necessary . 
but beyond the duty of remembrance which we must demand from all democracies , and the people of europe know just how difficult and painful a task this is , so difficult in fact that some european countries have not yet completed it , it is incumbent on us to ensure that such acts of barbarism , which destroyed lives for ethnic , religious and cultural reasons and which offend the conscience of the world , never recur . 
but there are still many areas where progress is unsatisfactory , or indeed non - existent . 
i am thinking in this case of the absence of a law abolishing the death penalty , the cyprus question and the occupation by the turkish army of one third of the island of cyprus , and the problem of the rights of minorities , such as the kurdish and armenian minorities . 
in this connection , i supported an amendment aimed at inserting into the body of the report a reference to the genocide in armenia , because it is important to acknowledge this historical reality . 
if turkey wants to enter into accession negotiations , it still needs to make a great deal of effort . 
if it wants to accede to the european union , it will have to integrate all the values which make europe what it is . 
this once again raises the question of whether turkey really wants to be a member of the european union , or whether it would prefer to organise an integrated ' whole ' with other middle east countries , which would have very close links with the european union at the commercial and economic level , at the security and stability level and also at the human rights and democratic rules level . 
this is , of course , a different debate to the one we are having today . but , given the importance i attach to turkey , i wanted to restate my case today . 
-- i and my colleagues have opposed this amendment because leyla zhana is insisting that she is not herself asking for special treatment or immediate release from gaol . 
she wants the penal law changed , as do we . 
moreover , we believe that not only kurdish , but all political prisoners should be freed . 
i voted for this motion for a resolution . 
present - day turkey is an authoritarian state with superior military power , political prisoners , censorship , party bans , border conflicts and an electoral system that excludes minorities . 
lessons still have not been learnt from the mass murder , eighty years ago , of the insurgent armenians . 
that partly explains why people do not think it untoward that a different national minority is still being deprived of its rights to this day . 
the kurds are displaced , bombarded and suppressed . their language is banned from use in administration , education and the media . 
turkey must first learn from the histories of greece , serbia , bulgaria , albania , syria , iraq and yemen . 
since the people are no longer prevented from exercising their right to self - determination , this has enabled peace to take hold . 
the necessary changes cannot be bought outside by the governing powers ; they must come from within . 
. ( it ) turkey must become an integral part of the european union as soon as possible , for this will both contribute to the fight against fundamentalism and the peace process and improve development and stability between the countries of northern and southern europe . 
we all know that , in reality , this decision was tainted with hypocrisy . 
nonetheless , the system that has been put in place will do its work and will impose its logic on us until the time comes when this awkward position will become so untenable that our relations with turkey will be in serious and deep crisis . 
in the face of stark realities , it is about fully respecting the dignity of the turkish people by not seeking to impose on it a behaviour which it must adopt of its own accord , and by seeking to jointly develop close cooperation . 
the ambiguity of the pre - accession procedure prevents real cooperation between turkey and europe from developing along healthy and clear lines , even if there is a powerful common interest for turke. with its influence and weight and the privileged relations it now has with the turkish - speaking countries of central asi. to be a powerful stabilising factor in a region which is in great need of stability . 
-- on behalf of the european parliamentary labour party , i welcome mr morillon 's report . 
we believe that turkey should be treated the same way as any other applicant country . 
while it is clear that turkey does not yet meet the copenhagen criteria , we should be working closely with them to achieve that objectiv. just as we have done with all the other applicants . 
we cannot consistently seek new obstacles to put in their path . 
in writing . - ( fr ) we voted against the jové peres report on community participation in the regional fisheries organisations because it calls for the transfer of national sovereignties , which would be completely counterproductive . 
for a number of years , as a member of the delegation for relations with canada , i have been able to observe the operation of one of the regional organisations , nafo ( northwest atlantic fisheries organisation ) , whose members are the countries of that region , including canada , as well as all the countries that use traditional fishing zones in the region , including france , spain and some other european countries . 
every member country has a vote in the decision procedure . 
now , from the moment the european nations concerned decided to communitise this issue and to be represented solely by the commission they have just had a single vote . 
so the first effect of the uniting of our forces was to reduce the number of our votes from six to one . 
the countries of europe , as a whole , have the same number of votes as cuba , for example . 
this situation does not worry the federalists for whom , when the commission speaks with a single voice , we gain in strength . 
the rapporteur 's answer is for the community to be given the resources , effectively , to take direct control over fisheries monitoring . 
this reveals the european union 's true ambitio. the continued acquisition of powers until it becomes an all - powerful superstate . 
it will only be content when its own gunboat fleet , flying " ring of stars " flags , is enforcing its fisheries policies . 
my party cannot support this report . 
. ( it ) the european fishing sector is currently suffering a series of challenges due to an increase in competition caused by the globalisation of the fish products market . 
there is also a clear need for greater protection of the marine environment and rational management of exploitable fisheries resources . 
in this context , it appears necessary to increase international cooperation and ensure that the community consolidates its undertaking to define a law on fish stocks . 
the principle tool for achieving closer cooperation is the regional fisheries organisations ( rfos ) , which play a key role on the international scene but which lack the human resources for the community to be adequately represented . 
the rfos are particularly suitable for achieving the objectives established because of their regional nature , but , above all , they contribute to the rational management of resources by reflecting the specific characteristics of the fishing areas . 
in this context , considering the importance of rfos for the future of the common fisheries policy and the different levels of organisation , competences and development of each organisation , the community needs to adapt its participation according to their respective characteristics and to harmonise its role within the 30 existing rfos , in order to speed up transposal of the recommendations adopted by the rfos into community law . 
-- ( fr ) without going back to the excellent argument put forward by mr gallagher regarding the text that has been submitted to the vote , i would like to extend the debate to cover all cases where our countries are represented by the executive commission in international negotiations . 
my comments naturally apply to the issue before us today , the representation of the european community within regional fisheries organisations , but they apply equally to talks conducted for example within the world trade organisation . 
if the commission has the power to represent the community and to negotiate in an international context , it is because it has received a mandate from the council . 
it is therefore important that this mandate is defined clearly in terms of time and content and that it is strictly monitored by the council . 
in a good many cases , such as fishing in certain regions of the world , the interests of member states are not uniform . 
i am not a hundred percent certain that this is the path the nice summit is preparing to take ... but there is still time for member states to regroup . 
that brings us to the end of voting time . 
i would like to thank those who have stayed to the end ! 
waste incineration 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 321 / 2000 ) tabled by mr blokland , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council directive on the incineration of waste [ c5 - 0371 / 200 . 
1998 / 0089 ( cod ) ] . 
mr president , when i was appointed rapporteur for the amendment of a directive concerning the incineration of hazardous waste , three years ago , i could not have suspected what it would lead to . 
a small subject grew into an extensive piece of work owing to the fact that proposals on hazardous and non - hazardous waste were combined in a single directive . 
the amalgamation had the effect of streamlining community legislation . 
a chastened parliament confined itself to adopting sixteen amendments at second reading . 
the need for conciliation soon became apparent because , as it turned out , the council was not minded to adopt these amendments . 
ultimately , after some tough negotiating , an outcome was achieved that is worth defending . 
i would like , just one more time , to give three reasons as to why the directive on waste incineration is so important . 
firstly , the emission of dioxins , as well as the emission of other harmful substances will be drastically reduced . 
secondly , the public will have far better access to information about incineration plants . 
thirdly , it will substantially reduce the disparity between the requirements governing incineration plants and those governing plants for the co - incineration of waste , such as cement kilns . 
but although i am upbeat about the outcome of this directive , it cannot conceal the fact that waste incineration is an emergency solution . 
after all , we have not managed to avoid the production of waste , nor have we succeeded in introducing recycling . 
finally , i anticipate our being able to tighten up the waste incineration directive in a few years ' time , in close consultation with industry . 
the people who live in the vicinity of these plants will thank us for it . 
mr president , i share at least one certainty with the rapporteur , mr blokland : incineration may be a significant source of pollution but it is in fact necessary today , given the very low levels of waste recycling . 
the urgency of this subject is made more acutely felt by the problem of animal meal in feedingstuffs , which we are going to be debating later this afternoon , which are going to have to be destroyed . 
the objective of this proposal , which aims to replace three directives relating to waste incineration , is to improve air , water and soil quality and human health by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to incineration and co - incineration , notably dioxins , furans and heavy metals . 
this proposal also allows for the integration of the technical progress that has been achieved since the 1990s . 
overall , the result of the conciliation process is very pleasing . 
the emission limit values for incineration and co - incineration plants have been brought into line , while taking account of the technical differences between these two activities . 
i have always been in agreement with the joint draft which regards these two systems as complementary and not competing . 
today , we cannot do without either of these incineration methods . 
yet one can only regret the fusion of these incineration processes in terms of hazardous and non - hazardous waste , which has considerably complicated the debate , and which i have always condemned . 
mr president , first of all , i think we have cause to thank mr blokland , the commission and the council for the cooperation there has been in connection with the directive . 
we all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non - hazardous waste . 
i want to draw attention to just three important objectives we can achieve by means of the directive . 
this is to happen by means of the operational requirements made in connection with incineration plant and also by means of the emission limit values we have now established for heavy metals , dioxins and other substances . 
i also think , however , that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth . 
it is nonetheless good that we have now obtained tighter rules covering waste incineration . 
i believe this will prove to be a significant contribution to improving the environment . 
mr president , i would also like to thank mr blokland for preparing this subject . 
it has been a difficult process drafting the directive , as circumstances and practices in the member states vary , and this affects many different interest groups . 
the end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non - hazardous waste , improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat . 
one of the hardest problems was to define what co - incineration meant . 
in some countries the best alternative , environmentally speaking , is that carefully sorted combustible waste can be burned in small municipal plants that produce electricity and heating . 
in the first draft sketches for these plants there was a call for unnecessary , technically costly and , in some respects , impossible tests . 
the proposal has improved during the debate . 
it is also important that industry can still use non - hazardous waste in its own production of energy . 
in my opinion , the problem was also that the directive went into precise technical detail which it was hard to get unambiguous opinions on from the experts . 
i think we in parliament should keep to the definition of the main arguments , allowing member states to take account of differing circumstances and continue with best practice with regard to the environment . 
a directive on the incineration of waste will increase the costs of burning waste , but will cut hazardous emissions and improve the state of the environment . 
our parliamentary debate achieved a reasonably balanced proposal that can serve as a basis for action throughout the union . 
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr blokland for his excellent work on this report and give my group 's support for the compromise text . 
with the toughening of legislation on landfill there has been significant increase in waste incineration , and i know from my own experience in my constituency in wales that incineration of hazardous and non - hazardous waste is as much a concern , in terms of its effects on health and the environment , as is landfill . 
it is essential that we do not replace one unhealthy and unsustainable form of waste disposal with another . 
incineration is not recycling . 
it is not a clean and safe method of waste disposal . 
genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention , re - use and recycling . 
thus , in the conciliation process we were able to agree that plants that incinerate more than two tons per hour should publish a report on their emissions each year and smaller incineration plants should be included in the lists that would come under public scrutiny . 
the limit values for emissions in the annex to the directive were definitely the most difficult point . 
i myself succeeded in having some amendments made to the report , vital for the continuation of co - incineration practices that have been in place in finland for years and which are more ecological than those contained in the directive that is now about to be approved . 
i am very happy about that , as the job i had as a new member having come directly to the second reading was not easy . 
the report by mr blokland , now at its third reading , was for many members of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , elected to parliament for the first time , the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice . 
the procedures chosen by the institutions work surprisingly well , however . 
the end result can be considered good , and with good reason . 
the important element in all this , though , was the genuine desire for cooperation on the part of the three institutions . 
the work of the countries to hold the presidency , portugal and france , was constructive , and we have to mention in particular the role of the commission , which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result . 
in my opinion , there is something to be learnt from this for the future and we must see to it that cooperation to achieve a more ecological european union works . 
mr president , honourable members , forgive m. especially mr bloklan. for being a few minutes late . 
i could not hear your introduction , but i can guess what was in it . 
first of all , i want to thank you for your excellent work as rapporteur on this report . 
the fact that this directive has passed through the legislative procedure so smoothly serves to show how important it is for all concerned . 
this directive will lead to significant reductions in emissions in several key pollutants across the european union , despite the fact that the volume of waste incineration will increase over the coming years . 
not only does it contribute to the fight against air pollution but it also covers the release of waste water , as mr lund has said , from exhaust gas cleaning and the quality of waste from the incineration process itself . 
the conciliation process was demanding , but a well - balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of parliament and the council have produced a better directive . 
the scope of the directive is much clearer . 
public access to information has improved . 
stricter emission - limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co - incinerate waste , as mrs evans pointed out . 
this has been largely due to the excellent work of the european parliament and its rapporteur , mr blokland . 
i am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balanc. a view reflected in your speeches yesterda. incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders . 
let me remind you that the directive is only one instrument in the whole waste - management concept of the commission . 
burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste , due to the waste hierarchy , and the commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy . 
of course , the overall objective is to prevent waste in the first place . 
in conclusion , this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
supplementary health insurance 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0266 / 2000 ) by mr rocard , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on supplementary health insurance [ 2000 / 2009 ( ini ) ] . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for almost ten years now the community institutions have been working on the issue of social protection , a major element of which is , quite clearly , health cover . 
today , member states , while retaining their own responsibilities through the direct application of the subsidiarity principle , nevertheless have problems in common which justify a debate at european level . 
the operation of social systems is directly affected by certain general trends including the unemployment and social exclusion generated by 25 years of low economic growth , which has restricted the overall potential tax yield , the ageing of the population , the consequence of the emergence of new diseases and , finally , increased health care costs due to advances in medical research and treatment . 
however diverse national situations may be , one can recognise in all member states a more or less general reduction in statutory cover , an enhanced role for supplementary health insurance schemes and a marked increase in discriminating factors . 
against this backdrop , a more global approach to health protection seemed to me to be necessary , taking account , of course , of the institutional context : responsibility for the organisation and financing of social insurance systems by the member states ; national social models shaped by history , and free competition governing the rules applicable to the insurance industry . 
providing guaranteed access for all european citizens to high - quality necessary medical treatment within reasonable time limits is a primary objective towards which the efforts and financing of obligatory and supplementary systems must converge . 
starting from the principle that every individual has a right to medical care and that healthcare is a social good to which all member states must provide access , it is unacceptable that some are forced to simply abandon healthcare , allowing unwholesome systems to take their place which are disastrous for our societies . 
the employment and social policy council adopted a european strategy for the fight against social exclusion in luxembourg on 17 october . 
the european charter of fundamental rights , which will be officially announced at the nice summit , recognises the right to social security and to health protection as a common reference value . 
in its fight to combat discrimination and social exclusion , and in terms of the responsibilities of each individual , the european parliament will take pride in giving a strong impetus to the establishment of a system which will allow the essential principle of solidarity to be practically implemented . 
to this end , i sought the opinion of the economic and social committee , which greatly clarified a number of points in a communication which was adopted with a very large majority . 
the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the proposals of the draftsman , ioannis marinos , gave rise to a large number of debates and favoured the adoption of compromise texts . 
a broad consensus was finally reached within the committee on employment and social affairs , which i have the honour of chairing . 
the proposed system contains a number of approaches , the first of which is the development of a common vision of universal services which allow access to essential healthcare within a reasonable timeframe . 
the second is the establishment of a community system to monitor health systems and their capacity to respond to specific needs : the collection of statistics and comparable data ; the development of effective cooperation between the member states and the pooling of good practice . 
it should be possible for this monitoring system to be organised by extending the tasks of a community agency that has already been formed . 
the third approach is the presentation by the european commission within a period of six months of a green paper examining a framework for supplementary health insurance schemes and proposing appropriate legislative initiatives . we have already called on the commission to do this and , commissioner , we are aware that it will involve a considerable amount of work . 
this will preferably be in the form of proposals for recommendations to include the following points : recognition by member states of a common concept of a universal service to govern the basic service which will enable every european citizen to have access to the necessary care ; establishing , in agreement with the private insuring bodies , guaranteed respect for the principle of non - discrimination ; organising a system of pooling costs in order to cover the costs of persons and groups with serious existing diseases , and encouraging private insurers to develop preventative measures . 
there should also be a proposal for a directive to include the following points : a prohibition on the use of personal medical data , such as genetic typing , a key point ; ensuring that persons joining a scheme are not in principle required to undergo a medical examination ; the introduction of an obligation to provide lifelong insurance by the insurer ; undertaking to reimburse persons working and moving within the european union in a more coordinated way and , finally , introducing a mediation procedure . 
it would be necessary to consider encouraging and supporting the codes of conduct for insurers concluded on a national or transnational basis , and an annual forum to study these issues . 
mr president , i should like to thank the committee chairman , mr rocard , for his words of praise in connection with my opinion . 
supplementary health schemes have also developed , over and above the reasons quoted by mr rocard , because there is a need for improved care as the result of advances in medical treatments , which are too expensive for national health services to pay for . 
however , they are also needed in order to compensate for the increasing shortcomings of national health services as the result of public - sector management , high costs and cutbacks in expenditure by governments , expenditure which has steadily decreased in all the member states during the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s . 
as in the past , these gaps are being filled and the increase in the demand for better health services is being increasingly covered by subsidiary and voluntary supplementary health schemes set up by public - or private - sector agencies on a profit - making or non - profit - making basis . 
however , there are huge differences between one country and another and we have no detailed or comparable statistics to help us ascertain reliably what applies where , what works best , where the weaknesses lie etc. , which is precisely why my opinion , which was drafted on the instructions of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , stresses the need , before any generally - applicable rules are introduced for supplementary health insurance , for the commission to submit a green paper containing an analysis of all these separate issues , together with the relevant information . 
we could then use the conclusions drawn from the paper to introduce some general rules for all the member states , in order to improve the quality of supplementary health insurance and ensure that it adequately meets the needs of the weaker sections of the population . 
however , these rules would need to take account of the subsidiarity principle , facilitate competition in the favourable sense of the word and not hamper the efficiency or speed of the private sector or its economic viability . 
i should like to end by stressing that the distinguished rapporteur , mr rocard , took extensive account of the scientific observations and many of the suggestions in my opinion . 
i should also like to thank my fellow members , mr pronk and mr karas , for their valuable contribution to the final report . 
however , medical treatment is costing more and more money ! 
however , equal access to health care must be available to everyone , without exception . 
this is important if we want a social europe that sets us apart from others . 
for example , although we often take the united states as a model for the free market economy , it would be a fatal mistake to follow their lead in health policy . 
for instance , we see that in the us system , health costs as measured against gross domestic product are nearly twice as high as the eu average , and that in the united states there are still some 40 million people who have inadequate health insurance . 
that is scarcely what you would call a responsible social policy . 
so , as far as the european union is concerned , it is more a question of seeking to develop a combination of health insurance and supplementary health insurance that does not sacrifice quality and is not socially exclusive . 
the debate on health insurance in the eu must not end up going down a blind alley . 
unless there are pan - european requirements for supplementary insurance , we will have to be extremely cautious about the existing systems . 
however , the individual country must decide for itself what arrangements it prefers . 
it would be wrong if the eu were to devise rules concerning , for example , data relating to health , or requiring everyone to be insured and , in that way , destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles . 
it is right that , in connection with serious illnesses such as cancer and aids , there must be a compulsory system , founded on the principle of solidarity , which ensures good treatment for everybody . 
supplementary health insurance must be just that : supplementary , for example , for those who are willing to pay for an extra service , or designed to cover the costs of more ordinary and frequently occurring illnesses for which actuarial calculations can reasonably be made . 
mr president , the debate which followed the presentation of this own - initiative report at last highlighted two concepts , one of which , unfortunately only too prevalent , involves favouring the commercialisation of all aspects of life and aiming to reduce supplementary health insurance to a mere project by placing it in the hands of economic operators and subjecting it to the rules of the internal market . 
according to this concept , the purpose of the market in profit - making supplementary health insurance schemes is to increasingly and crucially take on the role of supplementing the basic state systems . 
this view turns up its nose at the non - profit - making mutual insurance companies , which are vital players in supplementary health insurance in several member states . 
the report by michel rocard , which is being presented today as amended in committee , demonstrates the difficulty of overcoming these contradictions . 
it nonetheless leaves a bad taste in the mouth , because each time a private patient jumps the queue , as i did , other people have to wait longer with their problems . 
it is , of course , the same doctor , the same nurses , the same hospitals and the same resources in the health care sector which are to be used , irrespective of whether it is ordinary or private patients who are being treated . 
this means that the bigger the health insurance sector becomes , the fewer resources there are left for general health care . 
i think it is completely wrong that it should be money which decides who goes to the front of the queue . 
the same applies to the health of all the citizens of our member states and the cohesion of our territories . 
regional inequalities in terms of development are glaring enough . 
let us not add to this a two - speed europe of health . 
the committee on employment and social affairs ' new proposal is correct , suggesting as it does that there should first be a review of the situation in the form of a green paper and that only then should decisions be made about whether a directive or recommendation is needed . 
as regards the heterogeneous nature of the systems already in existence , there are member states in which individuals have to find a substantial proportion themselves , for example 40 % of the cost of outpatient treatment . 
in these cases supplementary schemes are more significant than in germany , for example , where 90 % of the population are covered by statutory health insurance which up to now has been obliged to guarantee necessary medical treatment for all . 
the report is based on the intention expressed by the council in 1992 to achieve convergence of objectives and policies in the sphere of social security , and it links these with the existing objectives announced in lisbon with regard to social cohesion and economic progress . 
i think the connection between these two elements is a very sound one . 
i expressly included a third element in my contribution in the committee , which i believe makes another strong case for european action in the field of health insurance ; in particular , the removal of obstacles to freedom of movement , and not just the free movement of services that bartho pronk talked about , but also the free movement of persons within the eu . 
it is not by chance that i am particularly used to facing such problems by virtue of my dutch background . 
we have a special combination of private , public , individual and collective types of health insurance system , which have undergone quite some upheaval in recent times . 
leaving aside for the moment the question as to whether these changes were for the better , one thing is for sure : far too little attention was given to the effects of these changes on cross - border workers , retired dutch nationals living abroad , and for example , germans and belgians working in the netherlands . 
in terms of european coordination , the current combination of fiscally financed national insurance for nationals , compulsory insurance for employees up to a certain income level and , in addition , private insurance with collective or individual regimes , is a downright disaster . 
the national insurance system is not subject to the coordination rules because it is not employees ' insurance and only applies to nationals . 
the private system has to do with the directives for the insurance sector in the sphere of competition . 
there is at present an on - going discussion in the netherlands about structural changes to the system . 
an opinion is being prepared on this in the social and economic council . 
mr president , i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his own - initiative report , particularly because it is precisely that : an own - initiative report . 
he affirms , especially in paragraph 17, that publicly funded health care systems should remain within the exclusive competence of the member states and i very much agree with this . 
he highlights the need to address the issue of health problems of tourists visiting other member states , and this is certainly a very live issue , as i know from the many letters on this subject i receive from constituents . 
but above all he draws attention , for example in paragraph 3, to the significant problems regarding the long - term sustainability of public health care systems throughout the eu because of the increasing cost of advances in treatment possibilities , as well as the growing demand from an increasingly elderly population . 
this is a major concern . 
we certainly need fresh thinking on this subject and that has to include new ways of private and public health care working together . 
his report is a useful contribution to that debate , though i hope he agrees in turn that the contributions made in committee , including those made on this side of the house , may perhaps have made it even more useful . 
it is certainly now much less prescriptive , which is good . 
health care is financed in different ways in different member states and the roles of private health insurers are correspondingly different . 
even the definitions of " supplementary " and " complementary " have slightly different meanings in different languages . 
so an absolute " one size fits all " solution for insurance is unlikely to be the answer . 
on the basis that amendments nos 2 and 3 are passed , which accept the suggestion of a green paper but do not dictate precisely what has to be in it , i shall certainly be calling upon my uk colleagues to vote in favour , though i shall be proposing abstention on amendment no 16 
if supplementary insurance becomes the general rule , we shall simply end up increasing workers ' contributions ; but if we have selective supplementary insurance , we shall also have discrimination and that is something we wish to avoid . 
in this sense , i think that , basically , we should await the commission study on current systems as well as a commission study on the american system and the schemes in operation in other countries because then we shall have a clearer picture of all this . 
mr president , those of us who have devoted ourselves all our lives to studying social issues will remember that the old manuals used to include a definition of social protection as a set of state protection measures to cover economically assessable risks affecting individuals or families which individual. family unit. could not cover themselves . 
health is , of course , one of the assets that we as individuals most value , though very often when we have lost or risk losing it . 
it is , moreover , a fact that social system. protection system. have been suffering from the influences and consequences of economic , demographic and public health situations , etc. and it is also a fact that economic recession , unemployment , social exclusion , the appearance of new diseases , the ageing of the population , as well as advances in research , improved therapies , the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover . 
well then , this means that we need to reflect at great length upon the reasons why public health care is in such a state . 
in my opinion , it is because public health care is paid for before the patient is treated whereas private health care is paid for after and if the patient is treated . 
and so i and my pensioner friends call upon commissioner diamantopoulou to put on a doctor 's white coat , to treat the european union 's poorly medical service and to make us better . 
mr president , commissioner , mr rocard , first i would like to thank messrs marinos , pronk and menrad , and last but not least , mr ettl , very sincerely for their support in getting my amendments accepted and in changing the objectives of this report . 
financing statutory health care and pension schemes is at the heart of the social and budgetary debate in europe . 
both have similar causes , with demographic change in the one case and specialist and technical progress in medicine in the other . 
both are based on a three - pillar model with state , company and private provision . 
we all know that these systems have been built up and interlinked in different ways and that they provide different cover from one member state to another . 
both sectors also have national requirements that act as an obstacle to mobility and flexibility for employees in europe and increase employers ' costs . 
so i am glad that the rapporteur has been willing to move from his categorical demand for a directive to an in - depth analysis in the form of a green paper . 
and i am pleased that we have abandoned the idea of applying the french model to europe in its entirety , which would not be possible here . 
in order to avoid any misunderstandings , i would once again like to stress that the present report concerns supplementary health insurance and not health care as such , although obviously the two cannot be separated . 
supplementing collective solidarity mechanisms with private or group insurance is completely in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity . 
the eu has already produced a piece of legislation on supplementary pensions in the form of a green paper , which has resulted in a draft directive . 
so information has been gathered , research has been carried out , the systems in the various member states have been investigated , etc. , which is certainly the right way to go about it . 
it stands to reason that the member states are ultimately the ones responsible for their system of social security . 
but , if insurance , and therefore supplementary health insurance , are offered within a common market , then this presupposes common rules on competition , insolvency , discrimination , transparency and suchlike . 
mr president , the original draft of mr rocard 's report contained proposals which could have destroyed the health insurance market in europe . 
it is fundamental to the insurance business that premiums are related to predictable risks . 
the best way to achieve these objectives is for the state to leave the private sector to get on with its job . 
the new proposal before us is for a green paper . 
this is better than the original proposal but even this is a step too far . 
today 's green paper becomes tomorrow 's intrusive and damaging legislation . 
the best way we can help this industry , and the patients it serves , is to leave it alone . 
the commission welcomes this initiative and it comes at crucial time because we have just launched a political debate at the european level on the reform of social protection . 
it is the first time that we have decided that there is a need for cooperation on reform of social protection systems at the european level . 
this report underlines the economic and social challenges posed by the measures relating to supplementary health insurance and , of course , supplementary health insurance is of vital importance nowadays because the basic insurance system is ripe for reform and because healthcare needs are becoming greater and greater . 
the report says there is a need for the commission to act and , of course , we agree . 
first , we must take into account the great diversity which exists at the european level . 
there are huge differences from member state to member state as far as the definition is concerned , as far as the functioning of the systems are concerned , the combination between the public and the private sector . 
as an example , as far as the differences in the role played by voluntary and supplementary health insurance is concerned , the coverage of the population by voluntary or supplementary health insurance mechanisms ranges from under 0.5 % in sweden to more than 85 % in france . 
however , these figures are somewhat misleading since both the concept and the coverage of the system differ significantly from country to country . 
the commission will act immediately in the framework of its competences and i will try to reply to the conclusions of your report . 
first , on the question of the green paper , the complexity of the issues is such that a green paper may seem premature . 
however , it is essential to draw up an in - depth report on the situation and we can do this as soon as possible . 
of course , we will take into account the wide variety of national systems and the complex nature of healthcare systems across europe . 
the commission will immediately launch a study of supplementary health insurance . 
i am very pleased to be able to tell you that all the amendments tabled by the committee on budgets have been adopted . 
in fact there are three points i would like to make . 
setting up a committee alone will lead to a six month delay in the establishment of the programme . 
it will take six months to set up the committee and then call a meeting , and the member states will not even need to use their usual blocking tactics , because all that will take at least a year . 
comitology really is a huge liability , as it is to this programme . 
i would like to ask the commission , following the example of what mr patten did , to reconsider whether it would not be possible to do something similar with regard to the member states . 
the committee on employment and social affairs allocated eur 100 million in the end. a suitable amount of this must be set aside for technical support so as to be sure that the programme is properly supported . 
any complaints about this from the commission are therefore unfounded as far as parliament is concerned , if this technical support is to be included in the programme itself . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on economic and monetary affairs would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report . 
we support the various elements of the programme , such as a multidimensional approach to this phenomenon , measures on health , education , housing , cohesion and complementarity with other related policies and the involvement of both non - governmental organisations and the very people who are subject to social exclusion . 
we support increasing the budget to eur 100 000 000 and we attach great importance to the need for the programme to be carried out at grass roots level . 
this is a real opportunity for the citizens of europe to feel that a social europe is being created and is a reality , rather than just a wish or a slogan . 
we therefore attach huge importance to collaboration with agencies at local , regional and cross - border level , which is why we tabled various amendments which , fortunately , were taken on board by all the groups . 
the equal opportunities committee stressed the need to take account in the programme of the fact that women are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion , particularly special categories of women such as immigrants , women with special needs , unemployed women , women with no modern vocational training and single mothers . 
mr president , i too am heartened to see that public finances in the countries concerned are sound , but i have noticed that more and more people are becoming nervous about the situation regarding price stability in europe . 
they state that , in one of the largest countrie. which is also one of the most important countries for the european economy , namely german. there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating . 
i should like to hear your assessment of inflationary development in germany and ask whether you think that inflation in the eu generally is cause for concern . 
as for the solution that can be adopted , it will , of course , be a national decision to be made in each of the member states ; the commission will not make any proposals in this regard . 
at the moment the impression i have is that the formulas being used in the various member states are moving in three directions . 
first they are moving towards a search for some system for financing the pay - as - you - go schemes , which may mean some element of pre - funding ; i mentioned the dutch system before , which already has obvious pre - funding elements . 
they are also moving towards making a public pay - as - you - go scheme compatible with private pre - funding schemes , and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds , which may obtain long - term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem . 
thank you , commissioner . 
madam president , i believe that the bse crisis that broke out in 1996 has revealed the extent to which ultraliberalism can lead to the health of consumers and the interests of livestock producers being sacrificed . 
but fraud , negligence and the lack of adequate measures mean that the bse crisis is still not under control , since new cases are being discovered all the time . 
without becoming paranoid , we must recognise that the consumers ' concern is perfectly legitimate . 
they have contributed to overly intensive production , which has harmed the environment and the quality of farm products . 
the reality is something else . 
consumers used to have doubts about quality ; today they worry about their own health . 
our citizens kno. because we cannot lie to people with impunit. that the crisis is serious . 
they know that if we are discovering sick animals in france , it is because we are looking for them , as was said earlier . 
we need far - reaching measures to be adopted at a national and european level if we want to avoid economic bankruptcy and a major health scare . 
we need to adopt the proposals put forward by the president - in - office of the european council , especially those banning animal meal in feed in all sectors of animal production . 
but we also need two additional , comprehensive plans , and i am calling for their immediate implementation , because any delay through hesitation would exacerbate the health and economic risks . 
the measures adopted by the french government in this regard are , as i said , inadequate . 
firstly , as others have said before me , we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by european citizens . 
for more than a year , the european authorities have been examining three screening tests , including the french test , which is deemed to be the most reliable and the most sensitive . 
this test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly . 
it has to be done , without hesitation and without delay , and on a massive scale . 
its immediate widespread use in the veterinary laboratories of the french departments would simply require the allocation of sufficient human resources until it can be automated . 
the test exists , it is reliable , and it can be carried out on a massive scale . 
i hope i have convinced you that it needs to be done . 
secondly , community farming needs to be reorganised to put our set - aside lands back into production so that we can grow soya , alfalfa and peas , which will give us the replacement proteins we are lacking and which will feed our animals much better than american gmos . 
we sacrificed our soya , alfalfa and peas in the course of the com negotiations in marrakech . 
and what about the labelling and traceability system , which will not be complete until 2003, despite the risks for consumers and the absence of a total guarantee for livestock producers ? 
now , in a panic , you resign yourselves to action . 
they now cost £ 75 a ton for disposal . 
for a medium - sized slaughterhouse killing 2,500 pigs a week , this adds £ 120,000 a year to costs , very little of which can be recouped . 
as to the way out , more funding of the agricultural sector is not the solution . 
we need species - specific feedmeals dedicated to specific livestock sectors so that mbm can continue to be supplied to the pig and poultry markets without fear of cross - contamination to the bovine sector . 
if that can be done , there will be no need for a continuing ban or for extra subsidies . 
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , this debate has one thing in its favour ; that at least it is highlighting the differences of opinion that exist among us , especially between the council and the commission . 
i too do not accept the arrogance of certain member states which , since they do not apply the tests , are not pushing for regulations . 
this is unacceptable . 
if france is now in the situation in which it finds itself , it is because it practises controls which do not exist elsewhere . 
commissioner , i am sorry that your colleague responsible for agriculture is not here and that he does not have the courage to face us and to explain that it is necessary to completely overhaul the common agricultural policy . 
i condemn the limitations and the worrying consequences of this policy . 
a reform of the cap is not just necessary , it is indispensable , because it is intolerable that a european country should adopt draconian measures and jeopardise its economy . 
european solidarity must also play a role , because our policy has exposed its inconsistencies : set - aside , animal meal for cattle , nitrates , pesticides . 
the cap must be reorganised to encourage farmers . 
madam president , one of the primary objectives of the european parliament , the commission and the council must continue to be guaranteeing food safety by enforcing effective laws and performing stringent controls which will restore consumer confidence . 
all this must be carried out in a climate of transparency and regularity so that the citizens do not feel that they are being swindled or sacrificed on the altar of major economic interests . 
we must prevent animals suffering from bse entering the food chain . 
we therefore need to develop an effective control system in all the member states of the european union . 
it is becoming vital to stop using meat - and - bone meal until it is proven unequivocally that using these feedingstuffs will not spread the disease . 
the panic spreading throughout the public is destroying an entire sector , and those who are least to blam. the breeder. are worst affected , for it is precisely the breeders , and not those responsible , who are the victims of the situation . 
breeders feed their livestock on products supplied by the industries , and a similar situation occurred in belgium a few months ago with the matter of dioxins in chickens . 
we call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis . 
we also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat . 
madam president , i would like to go into the financial implications of the matter , partly in my capacity as rapporteur for the agricultural budget . 
we have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole bse issue . 
a trialogue on budget 2001 is due to start tomorrow . 
yesterday , the coordinators of the various parties in the committee on agriculture and rural development lent their support to the proposal to earmark eur 600 million of the eur 1.3 billion still available in the agricultural budget for the fight against bse . 
i urge you to pursue a robust policy , or a different one at any rate . 
a number of points have been made about the implementation of legislation . 
i would remind you though , that no human being can go without food , not for a single day . 
on no account should we fail to give this priority its due from the political perspective . 
should it already be a problem with regard to inadequate levels of protein and other products , then i can assure you that european agriculture has sufficient potential to absorb this , also with regard to cattle feed . 
mr president , like many others , i want to thank commissioner byrne for his customary vigilance and also the french minister for being here today . 
as an englishman , i welcome the measures the french have taken . 
there is a general acknowledgement that bse , which began as a british disease and today is being presented as a french crisis , is really a european diseas. a european proble. and it must be tackled on that basis . 
there should not be any recriminations between the nation states or between different generations of government on this issue . 
we must tackle this . 
the minister said that mbm was a low - cost foodstuff . 
it is not a low - cost food stuff if it helps to spread bse and its human derivative . 
that is the essential problem here today . 
many speakers have said that we need to extend the ban on meat - and - bone meal as a mammalian food stuff . 
the uk already bans it from all farm livestock . 
our own food standards agency will be pronouncing very soon on intra - species recycling , and i hope they will condemn it also . 
we need to take these precautions , and we need to take them quickly for the benefit of all the countries of europe . 
mr byrne did not say very much today , as he was widely trailed to have done , about testing . 
i am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis . 
there are still doubts about the validity of tests , particularly on younger animals , and we have heard from other speakers about the huge size of the herd in europe that would have to be tested even if old animals are to be taken out of the food chain . 
we must take precautions now , not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned , but on behalf of the complacent minority of member states as well . 
it is for their benefit that we do it . 
the public 's feelings have really been whipped up , with the sole aim of securing the market for each country 's own beef . 
man 's food must be safe to eat . 
at this time , in addition to the developments and progress in our legislation , we must send the citizens a loud , unambiguous message . 
we must reassure the public that the europe of rights does genuinely protect the rights enshrined in its treaties and in the fundamental charter of european rights . 
i am sure , commissioner , that parliament will lend you all the support necessary for the new initiatives . 
we need clear measures . 
i feel that , until it is proved otherwise , a total ban on meat - and - bone meal has become necessary , just as the introduction of general testing and the harmonisation and effective implementation of community legislation in all the member states is necessary , and just as it is necessary not just to monitor the application of new labelling rules but to bring forward the introduction of these rules to the earliest possible juncture . 
i will end by affirming this principle : the cost of these measures will certainly be very high , but our priority is health . 
secondly , without these guarantees , the fall in consumption will impact negatively upon the entire industry . 
therefore , consumers and producers must unite to obtain greater guarantees of the inviolable principle that food should be healthy . 
madam president , i am very pleased that the commission is finally making a strong case for universal testing , because as the situation in france demonstrates " he who seeks shall find " ! 
commissioner , i urge you to ensure that these tests are also carried out in other member states . 
it is not acceptable if germany , for example , does not introduce universal testing , but just tests in north rhine - westphalia , for fear of no longer having bse - free status . 
i think that france has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step . 
i find it bordering on the cynical , mr byrne , when you say that this should not happen on environmental grounds . 
you cannot in all seriousness expect us to eat hazardous waste just to solve the waste disposal problem ! 
all in all , i regard it as somewhat shameful that there is so much talk here about compensating farmers and animal breeders . 
perhaps we should think about the victims for a change , and all the relatives of people who have died of creutzfeldt - jakob disease . 
commissioner , i listened to what you said very carefully and was most surprised when , at one point in your speech , you said that you did not have a magic solution to this problem . 
madam president , i am totally convinced that the union in its entirety lacks the political , moral and educational authority to talk about the quality and safety of food . 
nor is it a coincidence that the president - in - office and the commissioner refrained from mentioning the main source of all of these problems in the food chain , which is , of course , the common agricultural policy itself . 
the debate we are having today on the consequences of the bse crisis and how we can actually tackle them , is dealing with some very crucial issues . 
firstly , there is the issue of the tests that need to be carried out , and i welcome the fact that we are not going to stipulate a specific age for them . 
secondly , there is the question as to whether it is acceptable to use bonemeal in cattle feed , which has been the subject of lively debate here in this chamber . 
the link between feeding cattle bonemea. which is , as it happens a very unnatural way to feed animal. and bse is now clear to everyone . 
so action is called for . 
in the netherlands , the legislation governing the use of offal in animal feed is already relatively stringent as matters stand . 
there has been a ban on using proteins from mammals and ruminants in animal feed destined for ruminants since as early as 1989 . 
what is more , this regulation is continually tightened up and complies with requirements made at european level . 
the use of fat and blood is also subject to strict rules . 
therefore , i am amazed , under these circumstances , that it is still permissible for corpses to be used or processed . 
although there is no evidence of an absolute risk , i welcome the dutch proposal to place a complete ban on the use of meat in animal feeds with effect from 1 july 2001 . 
we cannot afford , in the light of past events , to allow this offal to enter the food chain , no matter what . 
together with my fellow honourable members , i advocate that we do not wait until july 2001, but enforce this ban now , with almost immediate effect . 
there is clearly a need for stringent european measures . 
so not just national measures , because the functioning of the internal market will be seriously disrupted if we constantly leave it to the national governments to decide to what extent the use of offal in animal feed should be banned . 
therefore , for the sake of the internal market , and in order to boost consumer confidence , i would advocate a complete and immediate ban . 
i would also ask the commissioner to initiate something of a uniform european approach to the issue of animal corpses and the collection thereof . 
there are increasing incidences , also in my own country , of dead sheep or calves simply being left behind because it costs too much to have them collected . 
therefore i would ask the commission to work towards a degree of harmonisation on this score too . 
the french government should also read this report because they are in danger of making exactly the same mistakes as were made in the uk at the time of our bse crisis . 
but we now have the benefit of hindsight . 
i suggest that the french government should learn from us . 
i have never been convinced by the argument put forward by france that the whole - herd slaughter policy was the right way to tackle outbreaks of bse in their country . 
the recent problem in normandy of an infected animal being presented as a healthy animal highlights the resistance there is in the farming community to having their entire herds slaughtered . 
furthermore , the recent tests that have been carried out in france of fallen stock have shown several hidden cases of bse . 
i have long been suspicious that in order to avoid having their whole herds slaughtered animals have been secretly shot and buried on farms in france . 
the british system of removing infected animals from the herds and paying good compensation for those animals encourages farmers to declare their cases of bse . 
i call upon the european commission to carry out a total review of the systems that are in place in france to deal with cases of bse . 
in britain we have also learnt that it is very difficult to stop meat - and - bone meal , that is produced and incorporated in the feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry , als. either by accident or by intentio. landing up in feed for cattle and ruminants . 
it is very difficult for a feed mill to guarantee that its production lines are completely cleared of meat - and - bone meal before they start manufacturing feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry . 
i have long been of the opinion that a complete ban on the use of meat - and - bone meal in animal feeds should be in place throughout europe . 
france has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many french provinces have stopped school children from consuming home - grown beef . 
one of the main reasons for this action is that the french food agency takes the precautionary principle very seriously . 
i would suggest that the european commission also use the precautionary principle in regard to beef from france . 
until such time as the french government can guarantee the absolute safety of their beef the commission should ban all exports from france to the rest of the community , especially from beef animals that are over 30 months of age . 
as far as carrying out generalised testing is concerned , i believe , certainly , that we must increase the number of tests , as indeed you have all called for . 
some countries have already gone down this road . 
so there are doubts , there are uncertainties , but i believe that our joint text and your debates here in this house have enabled us to make progress . 
to this end i listened most attentively to all your speeches , and it seems to me appropriate and crucial that the debate on the safety of our citizens is settled at the european level . 
mr martinez took part in the first one , and right here i have , if my fellow member would care to consult it , his minority opinion , which was expressed in writing at the time of the böge committee . 
we did not take part in the second committee of enquiry quite simply because we were excluded by the operation of the d ' hondt law and by the rules of procedure , or lack of them , in this parliament . 
question no 17 by ( h - 0848 / 00 ) : 
subject : minimum standards governing the expulsion of immigrantsthe council meeting of 18 december 1997 adopted a resolution laying down the priorities for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs for the period from 1 january 1998 to the date of entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , which clearly set out the objective of ' improving cooperation regarding the expulsion of... immigrants ' . 
the recent spate of instances in which various member states have failed to respect the most basic human rights when expelling immigrants is such as to warrant special attention for this issue from the commission . 
public opinion in the member states views existing repatriation policies as poorly coordinated and largely ineffectual . 
the commission considers that readmission agreements have an important role to play in clarifying and coordinating these policies , and the first community readmission agreements are currently being negotiated with russia , sri lanka , pakistan and morocco . 
the commission hopes that , under the 2001 budget , a financial cooperation instrument will be adopted with the countries of origin and of transit , enhancing their powers in the field of readmission and of voluntary return . 
bearing this voluntary repatriation in mind , i would remind the house that the european fund for refugees provides for specific financial measures to support the development of member states ' policies on repatriation , and that , with regard to the way this repatriation is carried out , i share the concerns expressed by mrs cerdeira morterero about the need for us to adopt common minimum standards establishing dignified and humane procedures and conditions for repatriation . 
mr president , i too will try to help in this miracle " timesharing " between the panel of commissioners and meps . 
that is my commitment , for which i accept responsibility . 
mr president , i only want to say two things . 
the list of examples given in the question is the result of selective memory , which i feel is hardly appropriate in these cases . 
but in short , commissioner , as of today we do not have an updated scoreboard , nor do we have a legal instrument to regulate the conditions and material assumptions of expulsion . 
on 12 december in palermo , the united nations is going to sign the world convention on organised crime with a protocol on the traffic in human beings . 
there is a direct relationship between organised crime and immigration . 
what proposals does the commission have concerning this matter on the basis of article 31 of the union ? 
violence against women takes many forms : there is violence in the home , a crime which does not speak its name , there is sexual exploitation and there is trafficking in women , i.e. trafficking in human beings . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , just one word : it is not true that women are only trafficked from the countries of the former soviet union or that most of them come from there . 
mr president , i would say to mr nogueira that clearly , in the model that we have defined , monetary policy is the responsibility of the central bank and it is the european central bank that takes action in line with the criteria established in the treaty . 
a problem of greater consequence is how to make a single monetary policy compatible with economic policies that are national in accordance with the treaty . 
this operation consists of everything included under economic policy coordination , which has two basic aims : first , that the economic policies of the various member states should not be incongruent with each other , and secondly , that they should not be incongruent with monetary policy either , generating a situation that could result in an over - restrictive monetary policy . 
we mean to carry out this coordination basically through the instrument of major economic policy guidelines , which are applicable in each member state that approves them and which include not only the major lines of economic policy but also specific recommendations for each member state . 
as a result of the stability and growth plan , however , we have also launched the so - called stability programmes . 
there is no question here either , mr solbes . 
you can see that all meps almost without exception are born to be commissioners , as they want to expound on the issues . 
we all know there is no time . 
you too are receiving this information on the current situation of each plan for changing over to the physical euro in each of the member states , so that everybody can choose the best practices in one country or another and we can all make as much progress as we can together and achieve the best possible results before the end of next year . 
question no 23 will be replied to in writing . 
if values are exceeded , the member state , in this case greece , will have to take action . 
what we do is to guarantee that there is a system of monitoring and measuring . 
if values are exceeded we ask the member state to take action and we follow developments . 
there is the possibility of using community funding for establishing networks and for measurements in greece . 
combating social exclusion ( continuation ) 
mr president , commissioner , the european union charter of fundamental rights says in its preamble : ' it places the individual at the heart of its activities , by establishing the citizenship of the union and by creating an area of freedom , security and justice ' , and in its first article it adds : ' human dignity is inviolable . 
europe has created a lot of employment . 
but i do not think we should be satisfied just with what has been achieved . 
to achieve a europe that encourages integration , in the words of the lisbon european council , requires joint effort and joint action . 
this comes through knowing the characteristics and the means that can get everyone involved , in society as a whole and in the various governments , on account of the need to quantify objectives and eradicate child poverty , because child poverty must generate other kinds of poverty and perhaps establish formulae of social exclusion that perpetuate poverty and perhaps even destitution . 
therefore , commissioner , i ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty . 
mr president , i would first of all like to thank our rapporteur and welcome the initiative she has taken to engage in dialogue with the council and the commission immediately following this first reading in order to work towards ensuring that better consideration is given to the amendments desired by parliament . 
following the mass unemployment of the 1980s , social exclusion risks becoming the new evil which will gnaw away at europe over the coming decade . 
when growth returns , it will be a challenge we need to take up if we want it to actually benefit everybody . 
this is not self - evident as this new growth is very unfair and , as we have seen in the united states for some ten years now , may be accompanied by persistent insecure employment , exclusion , poverty and urban ghettoisation . 
growth will take place under conditions inherited from the crisis : a lot of jobs are being created , but there have never been so many insecure jobs , temporary jobs and imposed part - time work . 
i believe that we must ensure that the phenomenon of the working poor does not become widespread over here as well . 
for many people , economic exclusion is accompanied by exclusion from decent housing and the lack of access to healthcare , training and culture , with certain groups being more exposed than others . 
this community programme does not aim to take it entirely upon itself to combat exclusion in the european union , but it must make it possible for europe to take action in a more determined , effective and coordinated way . 
to achieve this , it must be closely linked to the commitment that the heads of state and government made in lisbon in march 2000 to give a decisive boost to eliminating poverty by setting proper objectives which must be approved by the council by the end of the year , in other words , before the nice european council , which will take place in a few weeks ' time . 
i believe that the programme will not be fully meaningful unless it is linked to achieving this objective . 
how can this be done ? 
i believe we are all agreed about that . 
mr president , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her great commitment in dealing with this report on a programme of community action for combating social exclusion in which , as many have said , poverty can be an important factor . 
we are told that finding paid work is the best way of preventing social exclusion but i would agree with those who have said that we would have to take account of the fact that gainful employment alone is no guarantee of social participation . 
there are many elderly people who would agree with that , as would those who had worked for hours for low wages which do not provide a decent livin. farm labourers , for example . 
now , i am not questioning the good intentions behind this decision , but i am concerned at the results to be expected from this five - year plan . 
at the end of the day , we will in all probability , be more familiar with the statistics of social exclusion and povert. which is a good thin. and we will have guaranteed operations to assist some tens of thousands of people in europ. which is also no bad thin. but we will not have made any progress towards structural reforms which could have convincingly reduced poverty and exclusion . 
the report stresses two points : unemployment and the extremely low pension levels for certain categories . 
it is certainly true that these are two factors which lead to exclusion and poverty , but we must treat the disease rather than the symptoms . 
if we want there to be more jobs , we must have the courage to liberalise the labour market . 
where this has been achieved , even in europe , unemployment has fallen convincingly . 
mr president , i welcome the commissioner 's initiative and this report which seeks to improve upon it . 
europe has managed to avoid the economic crises that have hit many parts of the world over recent years . 
growth is picking up , inflation has been brought down to its lowest levels for a generation , yet we still have persistent poverty and exclusion . 
europe 's unemployment rate is still far too high at 8.3 % . 
well over half of the 14 million unemployed , according to eurostat 's latest figures , have been out of work for over a year . 
furthermore , according to the eu 's statistical service , 18 % of european citizens live below the poverty line , while one - third of those living in poverty are working . 
in my own country something like 75 % of those who are working and living below the poverty line are women . 
the situation seems to be getting worse . 
between 1980 and 1995 overall inequality rose in member states . 
globalisation , technological innovation and the emergence of a knowledge - based economy are coinciding with changing family structures , shifting gender roles and increasingly diverse societies . 
this represents around 75 million european citizens . 
in general terms , over the last ten years , the national poverty rate has ranged from 10 to 11 % for denmark and the netherlands to a very worrying 24 % for portugal . 
to this we must add the fact that more than 10 million people depend on assistance from social welfare systems , in a situation which is growing worse in most member states . 
this report is extremely important because it aims to improve the circumstances of the most underprivileged , thereby representing one more step towards strengthening social cohesion . 
for this i wish to congratulate the rapporteur . 
this budget should be increased , bearing in mind the processes and the realism that are necessary in this field . 
there must be further dialogue with non - governmental organisations and with other social partners , aimed at vigorously detecting the most concentrated areas of poverty and social exclusion and at defining the most efficient and effective ways of combating them . 
i urge the council to establish quantifiable goals , and specific , cross - sector action programmes to combat exclusion , based on indicators which provide considerable information so that closer cooperation can be translated into tangible and effective action , more in the social results that it achieves than in satisfying electoral needs . 
i support the need to gain more knowledge about the causes of poverty and i also support preventative action against exclusion resulting from mergers , industrial change , relocations , rural desertification , and urban ghettoisation , with innovative and tangible responses involving both sides of industry , local and national government and concerted action by the public . 
mr president , first of all , i too congratulate mrs figueireido on her work , which was approved unanimously , moreover , in committee , and on the innovative nature of her report on the establishment of a community programme to combat social exclusion . 
i therefore support the rapporteur in stressing that the programme , or rather the programme 's role , will facilitate greater social cohesion where the poor and the marginalised are concerned . 
as is stated in the amendments which i tabled in committee and which were subsequently adopted , i am convinced that an effective , practical fight against poverty must take place according to a timetable of events and targets . 
in fact , a programme with in - built deadlines and checks is easier to assess in terms of quantity and quality . 
these figures suggest that the budget made available for the programme will be totally insufficient . 
i therefore call for it to be increased . 
mr president , i will end by stressing once again that mutual support between states must be the reference point upon which we base a fresh fight against poverty and social exclusion , but we must take into account the fact that the economic progress of the member states , and therefore an improvement in their welfare due to the implementation of a social economy of scale , will certainly facilitate the achievement of a greater , better system of social justice . 
mr president , i would like to thank and congratulate mrs figueiredo and i would like to thank the other members of parliament who are not here and who have expressed the opinions of the other committees . 
it is a very important and constructive contribution and it supports the commission proposal for a joint decision of the council and parliament which will establish a community action programme to combat social exclusion . 
after the treaty of amsterdam and some months after the lisbon council , we all know that a new context has been created for community action in the area of social policies and social exclusion and social protection . 
there is a shift in the political debate at the european level and we can see that there is a strong will to combine social cohesion and competition . 
the proposed action programme has a legal basis , article 137 of the treaty of amsterdam , and we had a new mandate after the lisbon council . 
this programme has been designed to support implementation of the open coordination method which means that it will be possible to improve knowledge , to develop exchange of information and best practice and to evaluate experience to better combat social exclusion . 
there has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in combating social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and of the structural reforms . 
there was a discussion about the definition of " poverty " and " social income " . 
the gap is clearly increasing between rich and poor , but unfortunately it is impossible to participate in these discussions since i am obliged to focus on the proposed programme and on the way in which we will cooperate to implement this programme at the european level . 
i would like to inform members of parliament that , on 4 december , there will be a discussion in the committee on employment and social affairs on the new social agenda and on what we have achieved during the last year . 
there will be a very interesting political debate , and social exclusion will be at the centre of this debate . 
as far as the proposed programme is concerned and the report of parliament , i am particularly happy at your strong overall support for this proposal . 
i can accept a majority of your proposals either in their entirety or in spirit . 
i agree on your proposal to strengthen the reference to the conclusion of the lisbon european council . 
i also agree on the importance of improving understanding of social exclusion and poverty and of promoting comparable indicators and assessment criteria . 
i also agree to highlight the importance of ngos as well as of regional and local actors as you suggest , and of better reflecting their experience on the ground . 
something which is very important is that the commission has accepted an exceptional increase of up to 90 % in the rate of community co - funding of european networks of ngos active in poverty and social exclusion . 
however , i am not able to accept an increase in the budget from eur 70 million to eur 100 million . 
the budget that we propose is adapted to the aim of the programme and this aim is to encourage cross - national cooperation and mutual learning and not to fund actions on the ground . 
through the social fund and through the equal initiative member states ' ngos can be funded for particular projects for particular actions on the ground . 
i am unable to accept the remaining amendments for a variety of reasons : some because they are not in conformity with legal requirements ; some because they raise issues which fall outside the scope of the decision establishing the programme ; and some because they would confuse the message . 
finally , i would like to come to your proposal that the commission sets up , in addition to the programme committee , a reflection group . 
we cannot accept this proposal because it is against the comitology rules . 
but i would like to make the following pragmatic suggestion in response to your concerns because i entirely agree that we must find a way to have close and continuous cooperation . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , the sixth conference of the parties on climatic change is meeting at the moment in the hague . 
this is a summit which intends to slow down climate change and at which the kyoto protocol will undergo its ordeal by fire . 
in addition , it is inconceivable that the directorate - general for competition should move to regulate this kind of aid without taking into account the results of negotiations pertaining to the directive we have before us , and at the very least it can be seen as a snub to parliament . 
but tonight we are talking of extending the use of renewable energy . 
i am going to repeat three of our demands . 
clarity is essential as we put forward our point of view to the council . 
we want : binding targets , not indicative cut targets ; a rational definition of renewable energ. energy from waste , which is to be incinerated anyway , is a good idea . 
but mixed household waste ; old paint brushes , polystyrene packaging and discarded plastic toys are not renewable energy . 
another directive is needed for energy from waste , as mrs rothe suggests . 
thirdly , we want a reasonable and therefore a longer period of certainty in which renewable energy can continue to receive compensation for the external costs to society which its use avoids . 
let me finish with one very startling fact . 
the united kingdom could generate four times its power requirements from offshore wind alon. four times its power requirements ! 
i would advocate a realistic approach , an approach based on the knowledge that electricity production from renewable energy sources can never form a substantial element of total energy production . 
since the plea by the advocate - general before the court of luxembourg , there is now less risk of seeing guaranteed prices foiled by state - aid regulations . 
but there may still be a threat from seeking compatibility with the internal market . 
i believe that a politician is someone who needs to anticipate problems . 
i do not want electricians to cause interference between the two systems and to sow confusion and doubt amongst investors in europe by short - circuiting and manipulating the system of guaranteed prices . 
not only must guaranteed prices be tolerated , they must be protected by the directive . 
that is what politics is all about : making competition possible between the two instruments by protecting guaranteed prices and harmonising certificate - related issues . 
renewable energies is a subject which unites the citizens of europe at a time when europe is finding it difficult to get its citizens to support greater integration . 
i believe that a strong policy on renewable energies is a symbol of the europe of tomorrow . 
mr president , the dependence of the member states of the union on imported energy is massive and is growing all the time . 
reliance on fossil fuels is reliance on imported energy and the political decisions of foreign powers . 
using renewable energy sources will increase the freedom and independence of nations and is in harmony with the principles of ecologically and socially sustainable development . 
we are not trying to deceive others into believing that carbon dioxide is reduced by burning peat , but it is our own fuel , while oil and gas are imported goods . 
hence my amendment to maintain the strict emission standards of annex 5 of the revised directive for waste incineration . 
setting standards on the output side will foster innovation . 
mr president , at the weekend the opec ministers met in vienna and came to the conclusion that there should be no increase in production quotas . 
over the last 18 months we have seen the price of crude oil rise from usd 9.75 to usd 33 a barrel . 
as i see it , we are sticking our heads in the sand if we refuse to recognise that we are in the middle of the third oil crisis since the second world war . 
the first oil crisis in 1973 was a political one , as was the second oil crisis in 1979, but this is a lasting crisis , because all the indications are that reserves are by no means as large as we have been led to believe . 
this is also what individual studies indicate . 
i could even quote saudi arabia 's former oil minister , sheikh yamani , who recently said on austrian television that the oil age is coming to an end , not perhaps because of a shortage of oil , no more than the stone age came to an end for lack of stones ! 
and we cannot replace oil as a primary energy source by other primary energy sources , because they too would then soon be in short supply . 
oil cannot be replaced by coal , natural gas or uranium . 
so this directive is unintentionally topical right now . 
mr president , commissioner , we warmly support the draft directive for electricity from renewable energy sources . 
we see it as building on the work of our colleague , mr mombaur , in advocating a greater share of electricity and energy in the european union from these sources . 
clearly , the issues that divide the house are quite stark : the issue of the definition of renewable energy , for instance . 
many of us feel that energy from waste should be included . 
it is a valuable resource and it certainly renews itself day - by - day , and that should qualify it to be included . 
it seems a pity to exclude any category which can contribute to the overall achievement of energy from wast. whether it is for small - scale projects or part of the overall calculation . 
the key issue , however , that divides us is the question of the binding nature of the targets . 
we have grave reservations about this being in conflict with the principle of subsidiarity . 
we think our friends on the left and the greens are asking too much in this regard . 
it could scupper this directive , but we also think it is a matter of practicality . 
if you aim for these targets , there is a curious range of percentages between 6 % and nearly 80 % in different member states . 
this seems a very curious way of going about it , so we think the commission is right to aim for indicative targets . 
the third point in issue here is the length of support programmes . 
that will create uncertainty in our live. in the economy as well as other areas . 
i think we not only need to develop renewable energy sources but a modern energy savings programme to run in parallel with that process , as this dependence is also starting to become a matter of security for us . 
peat grows continuously . 
the formation of peat by assimilation and the production of organic debris are the same as with other plant biomasses . 
instead of a hundred years , as with wood , peat needs thousands of years to regenerate . 
we finns regard the forest and the marshes as almost sacred , and we know how to use them in compliance with the principle of sustainable development . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the use of sustainable renewable energy sources must be one of the principle objectives of a modern energy policy in europe as well , but there must also be obligations and certainties , dictated by common sense , of course . 
in this sense , hydroelectric power is important , and it has been both a burden and a blessing for the mountain peoples , for they have had to pay a very high price for their land and have watched local industrialisation processes spring up , associated precisely with the presence of this energy source . 
now this resourc. renewable energy par excellenc. must be fully exploited : without further harm to the environment , of course , and along with the introduction of compensation and repossession mechanisms for the mountain peoples . 
this directive does , of course , take the desired line in that here , at last , is genuine exploitation of renewable energies . 
mr president , i would like to thank mrs rothe for an excellent report which is very timely this week when we are struggling with the crisis of climate change . 
commissioner , we do have a problem : the provision of grid infrastructure to facilitate network access for renewables . 
there is a risk of renewables being stillborn or strangled at birth by the utilities that have a monopoly , if they can charge huge sums for grid access . 
one farmer in my locality with a wind project was quoted over eur 2 million for a connection and this is clearly a problem that i would like addressed . 
also , i would like to inform the commissioner that ireland can be competitive in wind energy in a very short time . 
we believe that we can be competitive given the correct initial support , and those do include grid access . 
i would like to inform mr chichester that off my own seashore there are already well advanced windmills in the sea , certainly a project that is going to be up - and - running within a short space of time , so i would like to invite him to come and see it when it does get - up - and - running . 
i am confident that he will appreciate it . 
mr president , increasing the proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources is a good move . 
the share of renewable energy sources proposed , 22 % by 2010, compared with 13.9 % now , is particularly ambitious and i am just wondering whether a directive which focuses on the market and makes no provision for parallel measures such as support for research will suffice in order to achieve it . 
one very serious question is how to deal with the extra generation costs . 
the directive talks about support systems , basically a premium paid to companies which operate in this sector , and relies on so - called market mechanisms for the final solution . 
this basically means that workers will be subsidising both the company 's costs and its profits and , of course , this would not happen if the energy generation and distribution industry were a nationalised industry , as we in the communist party of greece insist that it should be , and if it had not been sold off to the private sector on the orders of bid business . 
we therefore believe that this directive will not achieve its intended purpose . 
mr president , i would like to thank mrs rothe for her valuable work in drafting this report . 
as social democrats , we feel that sustainable energy must be given a fair crack of the whip . 
sustainable energy can contribute to fair distribution between countries . 
consumers must be given fair choices . 
in addition , sustainable energy provides a solid basis for the economy . 
our objectives in the field of sustainable energy are ambitious , yet still modest in the context of the climate problems we face . 
we need radical technological adaptation . 
so what we must not do is start fiddling with the definition of sustainable energy so as to be able to fulfil the objectives with minimum effort . 
that would be marvellous , but sustainable energy also demands large - scale investments . 
we will not be successful in our efforts to transform our energy system in the union unless we make energy polic. including taxatio. part of a common policy . 
the problem we have with different support systems in the member states , referred to by mr chichester , is but one example of the need for a more common approach in this field . 
but experience tells us from almost every possible field that every time demand increases by 100 % costs come down by an estimated 10 to 15 % . 
renewable energy is no exception . 
i could show you figures and curves here demonstrating that for both wind energy and photovoltaics this mathematical formula applies . 
the good proposal that you have put forward , commissioner de palaci. and i should like to pay tribute to your realism as regards energ. and the excellent report by mrs rothe are a step in the right direction by promoting renewable energies . 
looking at this issue we see only interests , whether they be in the field of securing supplies , protecting the environment , combating the greenhouse effect or creating jobs . 
of course , we must agree to finance environmental protection , and that is also where we see the limitations of the market . 
free competition does not solve all the problems and , more especially , it does not settle the fight against the greenhouse effect or against waste . 
member states must now accept the proposals that are being put forward . 
we must vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals from mrs rothe . 
i would like to conclude simply by mentioning three problems which have come up time and time again throughout this debate . 
the first problem is that of peat , which is an important energy source : in my view , it is not a renewable energy . 
the second problem is that of household waste : strictly speaking it is not a renewable energy , but one must guard against sending a negative signal as regards the incineration of household waste . 
finally , as far as the degree of constraint is concerned , i will simply sa. because i do not have any more tim. that an objective in itself is never constraining : it is an objective and everything must be done to achieve it . 
this is what we must do at a european level . 
mr president , i would first like to thank mrs rothe for her careful and sensitive work on this subject . 
i believe that it takes great courage to keep renewable energy in the spotlight in the way she has managed to do . 
i have just come from an opec meeting , and the price of usd 30 for crude oil provides us with an opportunity to make totally new investments in this sector . 
particularly in the field of research and development , it is important that , in future , we should pay more attention to renewable energy , and i especially have in mind gas from landfill sites and sewage treatment plants , for which there is a role in this regard . 
but i also believe that we should not forget education , because energy efficiency and energy conservation are undeniably important subjects for the future , in just the same way as making use of an efficient infrastructure . 
mr president , first of all i should like to congratulate mrs rothe on the excellent job she has done with this report and , what is more , on the spirit of consensus she has demonstrated . 
i am convinced that in all energy - related matters we should be aware that either we improve our sources or we shall leave the planet earth uninhabitable within a few generations . 
women are nonetheless excluded from the peace negotiations , and their needs and priorities are overlooked . 
in the commission for the reconstruction of tajikistan , which has 25 000 widows , only one of 26 participants was a woman . 
in the initial peace negotiations to bring an end to the conflict in burundi , two out of 126 delegates were women . 
no bosnian women took part in the peace negotiations which brought the war in bosnia to an end , and this despite the fact that the whole world was aware of the systematic rape to which women were exposed and of the responsibility they would be forced to accept for reconstructing bosnian society . 
when the stability pact for the reconstruction of south - eastern europe was created , no women at all were appointed in spite of their unique experience in peacemaking at grass roots level . 
they had even less of a role to play in the committee responsible for reconstruction . 
a house cannot be built on half a plot of land . 
local participation in the peace and reconciliation processes is important . 
i therefore urge the member states and the commission to support individual organisations engaged in conflict prevention and peace work at a technical , financial and political level . 
however , the presence of male peacekeepers leads to an increase in sexual violence and prostitution around the camps . 
un soldiers , including soldiers from eu countries , have been sent home following complaints of sexual violence in somalia and mozambique . 
peace is far too heavy a burden to be placed upon only one institution , one government or one sex . 
sustainable peace cannot be created if half the human race is ignored . 
peace can only be achieved if women participate fully in the peace process . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur , mrs theorin , for adopting this topic , the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution , as the subject of a european parliament own - initiative report . 
women are especially affected by wars and conflict situations because of their responsibility for their family , their children and the elderly , but also because they often assume sole responsibility in the absence of their husbands and fathers and accordingly often have to ensure , single - handed , that their family survives . 
the situation is also particularly difficult for women , however , if they still have to fight for recognition and for equal rights in practice . 
decisions on implementing relief programmes are the responsibility of crisis teams , and the specialist knowledge and expertise of women is often not recognised or not given due respect by such teams . 
yet it seems all too obvious that the people to involve in such difficult situations are those who bear responsibility on the ground , on the home front as it were , and can contribute to resolving conflicts from their own experience . 
comfort women , mostly from korea , were raped and duped into becoming sexual slaves during the second world war by japan , which does not want to acknowledge this crime . 
the majority of refugees are women and children . 
it is true that we women are those who suffer most in war zones but we are more than just victims : we are the bearers of alternatives to war and violence and the builders and protagonists of change . 
there is the example of the international network of the ' women in black ' who are against war and violence and have been demonstrating for 12 years in israel against the military occupation of palestine , in dialogue and solidarity with palestinian women . 
we women members of parliament also saw them during our visit to the middle east at this tragic time . 
but these projects and the skills which women have , diplomacy on a practical level , which provides an alternative to state diplomacy , can no longer be disregarded ; they must be used in decision - making forums and at all levels of diplomacy . 
this is why more women must be involved in negotiations , in prevention operations , in management .. . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , a great deal has already been said and i am not about to lapse into repetition . 
i would like to congratulate mrs theorin for broaching a subject at european level that we have rarely discussed . 
when i listen to the various comments made , i find myself agreeing with those who recommend that we take a look at our priorities and then limit the number of aims we want to achieve . 
there is a great deal in the report and we will not be able to do everything straightaway . 
i will mention several of my own priorities . 
firstly , we must urge all the member states to ratify the treaty of rome . 
remarkably few have done so up to now ; only two or three , so i am told . 
so achieving that alone would be a start . 
it is recognised in this treaty that rape committed during wars , and all the consequences thereof , must be regarded as a war crime . 
perhaps that is exactly what you would expect in this day and age , but it certainly was not the norm up until very recently , nor did it happen as a matter of course . 
secondly , on 31 october a resolution was approved in the security council , namely resolution 1325, which ' calls for broad participation of women in peacebuilding and post - conflict reconstruction " . 
i am referring to the security council of the united nations . 
i think it would be worthwhile , under the circumstances , for the european union to take a look at what points were raised too , because they have been adopted within the united nations , and so they must also be taken on board at european level . 
around eighteen points were raised , which is quite a few . 
once again , my congratulations , and let us hope that something comes of it . 
mr president , commissioner , i should like to start by congratulating mrs theorin on her excellent own - initiative report , which deals with an important and topical issue , i.e. how the fundamental participation of women in negotiations to resolve conflicts can change the world and turn the dominant culture of confrontation and violence into a culture of peace , dialogue and democratic conflict resolution . 
this is made possible by the fact that , historically , women as a whole have stood for non - violence , have different experiences from men of war and conflict and devote all their time to protecting life with dialogue , reconciliation and negotiation . 
these pacific qualities in women could provide an alternative solution , the basis for the foundations of a new civilisation , a civilisation of peace , in which dialogue is protected at all levels and from which war and violence are excluded as a means of resolving differences . 
the absence of women , and of the pacific system of women , is all the more noticeable in areas in crisis , such as the middle east , which i visited recently . 
i am convinced that if women , both palestinian and israeli , had a say and a role in the peace process , there is every likelihood that a fair and viable solution to the palestinian question would have been found and we would not now be facing the present crisis , which is the outcome of 7 whole years of failed negotiation . 
in the case of iraq , which i visited as a member of a mission to contest the embargo in practice , women would not , under any circumstances , have put political or military objectives above human life and would not have sacrificed 6,000 innocent children a month in the name of any form of political , economic or strategic interest in the area . 
that is why this dimension needs to be taken into account when drawing up european union policies in the future . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to concur with the many interventions and congratulations delivered by other speakers , and i would particularly like to echo the sentiments expressed by mrs theorin in connection with the role of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts . 
that is why i support the full report in its almost original form and we feel that the majority of the amendments tabled by our colleagues have the effect of watering it down and are even downright hypocritical in some cases . 
mrs theorin has written a combative report and we hope that the aid for adoption centres will not be scrapped , see amendment no 19c . 
the greens do not support the compromise text drawn up by our fellow delegates in connection with amendment no 19 . 
i would like to congratulate mrs theorin on her boldness and strength of purpose . 
mr president , in my view , mrs theorin 's report goes a long way towards meeting the requirement that women should have equal social status . 
mr president , i congratulate mrs theorin on this magnificent report and i believe that all of us , as women , should be happy , since it is we who are going to benefit directly or indirectly from her courageous and innovative proposals and contributions . 
in my view , this territory is full of possibilities and could surely change the grim landscape of failures which , for centuries , have resulted from the exclusive domination of men . 
in this field there has been nothing but shameful failures but nevertheless we are still faced with a brick wall which excludes women . 
this is a very well informed , in - depth , and rigorous report , which is capable of stating fundamental principles with the clarity demonstrated in paragraph 17 . it is audacious but , at the same time , contains considerable practical sense and very necessary proposals . 
mr president , it is a great shame that it has had to be diminished for the sake of reaching a consensus ! 
it is shameful that nobody is here representing the council . 
mr president , please tell me who is representing the council at the moment , or the high representative for the cfsp . 
please communicate our protest to the council . 
mrs izquierdo rojo , the council never attends sittings in the evening . 
part of the problem is that when we arrange the agenda we postpone important subjects until the evening . 
the conference of presidents is responsible for this , and if we wish to change this , then we need to make sure that debates on renewable energy sources or important women 's issues are not scheduled for the evening , because , as i have said , the council is never present at that time . 
if i may make a personal comment , i believe that we would make rather more progress , regardless of what you may think about the contribution of the only man taking part in this debate , if more men participated in debates of this kind . 
regulating domestic help 
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0301 / 2000 ) by mrs smet , on behalf of the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities , on regulating domestic help in the informal sector ( 2000 / 2021 ( ini ) ) . 
mr president , we are now descending to the level of a more everyday problem , namely the regulation of domestic work performed by third parties in private families , for that is the subject under discussion . 
so that is one aspect . 
a second aspect is that the cost to the employer , i.e. the private family that employs domestic help on the regular market , the white market , must not be notably higher than the cost of such labour on the black market , because otherwise it stands to reason that undeclared work will remain the order of the day . 
a third aspect is that the employee , i.e. the domestic help , must stand to earn more than they would from working ' on the black ' . 
fourthly , we need to look into what kind of social statute can be established in this connection . 
finally , all this will inevitably involve financial intervention from the government , be it fiscal or parafiscal , because a private family would not be able to afford a full statute , even a limited one , and then they would all carry on taking people from the black market . 
mr president , commissioner , domestic work is the oldest work that women have carried out . 
this work has not been recognised or valued , either economically or socially . 
today it is part of what we call the hidden economy and this has a negative effect on those who carry it out and also on states ' finances . 
however , it is a form of work with a flexible timetable , which is of great assistance in reconciling family life with professional life . 
changes in family circumstances mean that this work is of increasing importance in the world of work , and it is therefore essential that this type of work be defined and that studies be carried out to assess the numbers of people involved . 
this is an area of work that must be fully recognised and that should be included in the directives on employment to regulate the social rights of the worker . 
the countries of the union today have greatly differing situations , which should be standardised . 
the workers , mostly women , should be provided with access to training . 
of course , both employers and worker. generally both wome. are often happy with this state of affairs , which saves money . 
we need to educate people and to expand and improve the basic framework that already exists in some countries , so as to provide incentives to phase out the present grey economy . 
in austria , and especially in my own region , an eu - assisted project involving a women 's advice centre acting as an agency for domestic helps has been very successfully running for three years . 
many women have been able to obtain a permanent job through this work . 
in addition , as a result of this project , two or three families have often clubbed together to employ a domestic help . 
what we are talking about is registering every contractual relationship between employer and employee and ultimately enhancing the work prospects of domestic employees . 
mr president , i am forced to admit , following mrs smet 's report to parliament , which i welcome , that i am in the unfortunate position of having to say that the commission has no special policy or information on regulating domestic help in the informal sector and on transferring domestic help from the informal to the legal economy . 
according to the communication , the first two basic steps are , first , you must record and compile statistics on domestic hel. as mrs smet has said , there are as yet no statistics at european level or in many member states on this proble. and , secondly , you must deal with it by integrating it into the overall strategy on employment . 
this strategy to transfer undeclared workers to the legal economy calls for a combination of individual policies which might be sanctions in the case of exploitation , information campaigns , which are needed at all levels , on the benefits of legalising these people and , thirdly , constant effort to harmonise and modernise legislation . 
however , what i can say is that the guidelines for 2001 are the first to clearly mention undeclared work and that we intend to work on the basis of the proposal in the conclusions and compile statistics and studies to record the problem so that we can hold a second debate and discuss what the next step should be at european level . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
( the sitting was closed at 12 midnight ) 
address by mr kostunica , president of the federal republic of yugoslavia 
mr president , it is with tremendous pleasure , profound respect for you and the people of yugoslavia , and with great hope for the future that is opening up in your country and in the new relations between us that the european parliament welcomes you here today . 
i extended this invitation to you on the very day on which the result of the democratic elections left us with no shadow of a doubt of the will of the people , which had been expressed freely and overwhelmingly in your favour . 
now that the dark pages of the last ten years have been turned , your presence before this house bears witness to our common desire to see yugoslavia quickly rediscover its rightful place in the family of europe . 
you expressed this wish yourself when you took office and , for its part , the european union immediately made the first significant gesture of confidence that you were seeking , the lifting of international sanctions . 
as regards the most sensitive issues that remain to be resolved , notably in relation to kosovo , the european parliament has always hoped that peaceful solutions will be found , in accordance with un resolutions on the integrity and sovereignty of yugoslavia , in terms of fundamental human rights . 
not only should we build democratic institutions , a task we have already embarked on , we should also imbue them with the democratic spirit , which may prove much more difficult . 
not only are we to carry out privatisation of our centralised economy , but also create a legal system that would guarantee the freedom of business operations and the entire economic process . 
not only are we to create the internal system of freedom and peace , but also harmonise it with the rules and customs that the european community and the european union have maintained for decades . 
simultaneously with building the confidence of our citizens in our state institutions , we have to persuade them to trust the european institutions that , in nearly fifty years of their existence , have brought to their citizens lasting peace and prosperity . 
the democratic changes that began in yugoslavia on 5 october have produced at miraculous speed extraordinary results on the international political plane . 
yugoslavia has regained its seats in the united nations and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , joined the stability pact for south eastern europe , while proceedings for its admission to the council of europe have been initiated . 
our most important task now is to begin to settle democratically internal relations in the federal republic of yugoslavia . 
kosovo , of course , is unquestionably our most difficult problem . 
there cannot be any doubt that the issue of kosovo 's status is a democratic issue . 
we have proceeded from the point that the un security council resolution 1244 offers possibilities of intensifying many important humanitarian and democratic processes . 
we need european assistance and support in securing the return of kosovo refugees to their hearths as soon as possible in the spirit of the best democratic traditions . 
of course , we need great help in rehabilitating their destroyed homes so that the refugees have somewhere to return . 
we call upon europe to come resolutely to our aid in creating security and the economic conditions to help the exiled feel completely safe on return to their homes . 
i believe europe has both the strength and the will to help us exercise the fundamental right of each and every human being to live in his own home . 
also , we will need europe 's assistance in establishing and resolving the great ecological problems caused by the use of depleted uranium in the bombing of yugoslavia . 
we are ready to begin open dialogue with albanian parties about political , humanitarian , security and all other key issues of relevance to a democratic solution to serbian - albanian relations in kosovo . 
when it comes to relations between serbia and montenegro within the federal state , the former , non - democratic organisation of the federal republic of yugoslavia seriously threatened the functioning of the state . 
the first step ahead of us in a bid to restructure the federal state constitutionally is to define a framework for the broadest possible democratic dialogue about the character of relations between the two republics . 
it will take a lot of patience and wisdom for us to identify , through talks in the republican and federal parliaments and a wide public and expert debate , the best solution for restructuring the federal republic of yugoslavia into a good , operational , rich and just state that cares about the interests of its citizens , and safeguards the full equality of the nation - building traditions of montenegro and serbia . 
it is important to say that muslims and albanians inhabit serbia and montenegro in significant numbers . 
there is not a single good reason for them not to be a factor of integration in yugoslavia . 
a democratic joint state makes it possible for muslims and albanians in montenegro and serbia to live in a single state , and enables us to join forces in building our equally joint state . 
support from europe is essential in our effort to seek solutions through sincere dialogues only and with respect for full democratic procedure , without pressures and ultimatums on any part . 
on the other hand , we would like to be given a chance to prove to europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of serbia and montenegro within yugoslavia on our own , by recognising the genuine principles of democracy . 
development and local self - rule inyugoslavia is the issue we pay special attention to . 
we are aware that it is the very core of any democratic system , and it is with due consideration that we are analysing european and our own experiences in developing local self - government . 
the grave situation in the yugoslav economy has been discussed at length . 
the humanitarian aid to our country that has been initiated is priceless , but we hope that europe will replace it with investment programmes that would make it possible for us to work and earn enough for a normal life . 
bearing in mind all these enormous problems , it is clear that our road to rightful entry into europe , in which serbia and montenegro used to have places worthy of them , will be a long one . 
yet it is certain that our chances today are much more realistic than they were a mere month and a half ago . 
perhaps the citizens of the european union can understand that best if they evoke their historic memory and those long - past years after world war ii , when the prospects for the continent and european civilisation itself were extremely uncertain . 
then your brave predecessors embarked on an uncertain project that bore historic fruit . 
i consider a fifth important amendment to be that relating to the annual report , which must relate specifically to the documents that must be kept secret , or which are kept secret at any rate . 
that could be reviewed again on an annual basis in order to establish whether it is reasonable or not . 
the european commission has advised us on an informal basis that it has not quite finished working out the position vis - à - vis parliament . 
at present , we are creating an open and modern - style administration , in which it is natural that the public should have this direct right . 
obviously there have to be limits to such a right , and that is something we are also discussing today . 
at the moment in the european union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation , and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive member states have been fighting for increased transparency for many years . 
however , the report does not sufficiently explain how possible separate provisions , which would remain in force at the same time as this regulation , would meet the criteria of greater transparency . 
this is a vague area , and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force , and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments . 
as regards the definition of documents , this is a crucial question , and we could surely argue about just that for a whole year , which is probably what has happened . 
the statement by the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport , too , in fact goes farther than the commission had proposed . 
we drew inspiration from the nordic models for transparency in administration , for the nordic countries have a very long tradition of having the right of access to documents . 
in the opinion of the committee on petitions , the importance of registers is mentioned . 
registers are important if we are not to have a form of public access to documents that is insider access . 
the committee would like all documents to be included , irrespective of whether they have been drawn up by the institutions or whether the institutions have them in their possession . 
of course , the institutions can be given time to consider documents , but in that case it is not a question of forever preventing these documents from being released . 
when this time is up , it must also be possible for these documents , too , to be evaluated . 
we must also do the balancing mentioned by mr cashman as rapporteur . 
we must always weigh different interests against each other : the interests of having a public discussion and the interests of protecting individual people , for example . 
it is also important that the parties affected have rights . 
we wish to emphasise that these parties must have more rights than the general public . 
however , the issue here is the public 's , not parliament 's , access to documents . 
it is gratifying that parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness . 
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr cashman and also mrs maij - weggen for an excellent collaboration , which has in fact created a good basis for the continued negotiations . 
there are no block exemptions relating to foreign affairs or security , and neither must there be any block exemptions in these areas in the future . 
another important principle , which has been one of my hobbyhorses since the debate on openness began , is that , as far as possible , documents must be made available in electronic form on the internet . 
this is something that parliament has supported and will probably also emphasise again today , which is important . 
i regard this as a very good example of swedish and nordic influence on the system of the eu . 
mr president , i would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work . 
increased openness will reduce bureaucracy and the opportunities for cheating and fraud and , at the same time , increase the legitimacy of the institutions among citizens . 
i will not get too bogged down in some of the details of the repor. it is always possible to wish for more when it comes to detail. but keep to the main principles . 
the basic principle of the proposal on our table now is that all documents must be made public . 
those countries which have better systems will not be adversely affected , but will be able to retain their systems . 
furthermore , a report must be sent to parliament every year so that we might continually follow up this action . 
i would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible . 
in our group , we have also discussed the possibility that the visually impaired and those with other types of functional disability should be able to receive documents in a form other than written form . 
i would like to draw attention to the internet and other possibilities which in the future may facilitate access to documents . 
i would like to conclude by saying that , in parliament , we must be very unified in supporting this comprehensive proposal , because the problems do not lie with ourselves . 
it is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the council and the commission . 
that is the most important thing , and that is the task we face . 
mr president , transparency and openness do not appear in a good light in the european union . 
the guiding principle must be that all documents are accessible , subject to certain exceptions . 
that is the will of this parliament . 
all in all , the eldr group feels that the proposal has been substantially improved on , but that there is still room for improvement nonetheless . 
i would point out that the arrangements pertaining to the registration of documents are too complex , the grounds for exceptions could be formulated better , and that non - european eu citizens have a right to openness too . 
the stipulations concerning the duty of the commission and the council to provide parliament with information , have no place in this legislative proposal . 
the doctrine of political responsibility must not be confused with the citizens ' rights to openness . 
all in all , i call upon the social democrat and conservative groups , and , of course , the others too , to support our amendments . 
mr president , a word about the position of the european commission , because i have already talked about the council . 
my group and i have our doubts about the european commission . 
in other words , as i see it , a link has been establishe. erroneously s. between the rights of parliamentarians and the rights of the public . 
today , as a tool to help us exercise this civil and political right , we have the internet , a term which has a strange ring within the european institutions and which , although we are starting to make use of it , is not exploited to the full . 
the internet is a remarkable tool , and it is certainly now the simplest , most economical and most easily accessible tool available . 
we will therefore vote for the amendments facilitating its use . 
the argument that it could undermine the effective functioning of the institutions is not sufficient grounds for the denial of access to documents . 
this provision must be deleted or at least supplemented by the obligation to weigh up the various interests . 
the purpose of this regulation is to optimise access to documents while adhering as far as possible to the principle of openness . 
the proposed regulation can only achieve that aim if the list of exceptions in article 4 is toned down , to say the least . 
mr president , today the house is debating a very serious and important issue because this debate is about one of the most important legislative texts which we , as a parliament , are required to examine . 
and it is an important legislative document because it concerns the quintessential relations between the man in the street and the institutions , these relations being no more and no less than his facility to access the institutions . 
i shall just conclude by saying that i think it was a pity that mr jens - peter bonde had got the wrong script for his intervention today . 
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone else involved in this work . 
this is a very important report , which forms an important part of what we might call the eu 's new principle of public access to official documents . 
included in this , apart from this draft legislation which regulates citizens ' right of access to documents , are the framework agreement between the commission and parliament and other agreements such as the solana decision . 
it is now that we have the chance to make the eu more open and more democratic . 
it would be an enormous disappointment if we did not succeed with this . 
it is a matter of legal security , an efficient administration and effective democracy . 
mr president , i would like to thank mr cashman for his excellent work . 
however , he is not the only one i should like to thank , as my sincere thanks also go to hanja maij - weggen , of the ppe - de group , who is the other rapporteur , thanks to the enhanced hughes procedure . 
i am glad that they have been able to work in close and successful cooperation in this matter . 
naturally , the documents these bodies hold must unambiguously be included within the scope of provisions on accessibility . 
it is technically cumbersome to classify these bodies in a separate annex , as new bodies are forever being created or changed . 
it would be better to create provisions in the paragraphs themselves , which would oblige all bodies to publish their documents and create registers on them . 
secondly , i would like to draw attention to the work on derogations . 
the provision of derogations is a very delicate matter , and what is otherwise an excellent report and a huge increase in transparency will very easily be overshadowed in the minds of the public by any clumsy set of provisions on derogations . 
naturally we have to finally decide on the sort of practices which would shed public light on the work of the council , and no set of derogations must be allowed to let the council retreat behind it in the way it did before . 
but it is just as important to temper public opinion , which borders very much on the paranoid as a result of exaggerated secrecy with regard to documents on such matters as security and defence . 
in fact , it is important , as far as security is concerned , that the public can judge , using facts and documents , just how much confidence they have in european defence . 
mr president , we are now in a situation in which we can really say that steps are being taken in the direction we have wanted for many years , and the principles of which were agreed in the treaty of amsterdam . 
transparency must become a founding pillar of all the work of the european union , but the right to access documents is still not enough in itself to establish transparency . 
we must see to it that the work of all the institutions is based on transparency , clarity and intelligibility , and that means that the decision - making structures are clearly visible . 
bureaucracy has also to be avoided here . 
the times being proposed for the release of documents must be absolute deadlines , because in normal circumstances documents are readily available to the public . 
i also think it is very important that this report proposes a yearly review as , then , lists of documents that have not been able to be made public , can justifiably be gone through . 
at this stage we would also then have the chance to examine , on political grounds , whether the suppression of documents has been judged entirely appropriately . 
i hope that this report is received favourably here in parliament . 
this gap is symbolic of the distance between the european union and its citizens . 
our people regard europe as being undemocratic , a place where decisions are taken behind closed doors . 
i would conclude that the council committed a serious error in july when it categorically declared all documents about military affairs secret . 
this decision illustrates just how far we still have to go before europe actually has a democratically controlled security and defence policy . 
that is why parliament is calling for european security and defence policy to be embedded in the structures of the european commission in future . 
firstly , we must tackle the insupportable decision taken by the council . 
naturally parliament recognises the need to keep certain military matters secret , but only if this is done on the basis of an assessment of the content of each individual document , and with the aid of verifiable criteria and procedures . 
parliamentary control of secret documents could then take place via a parliamentary select committee . 
mr president , access to documents is fundamentally important to our european democracy . 
the council and the commission must deliver the goods with interest in the negotiations due to take place in the coming weeks . 
i would also like to say how much the commission and myself appreciate the efforts made by the rapporteur , mr cashman , and the draftsperson of the proposal , mrs maij - weggen , to present this report in such a short period of time . 
when president prodi addressed parliament on 3 october , he referred to the institutional triangle and stated that , in a european system based on checks and balances , the efficient functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest . 
we are therefore unable to agree to some of the amendments without prejudging a future negotiation and a definitive position in relation to it . 
the commission is pleased to see that the european parliament agrees , to a large extent , with its view of many of the aforementioned issues . 
furthermore , other amendments do not present any problems of principle . 
we must go further in relation to the ways in which the regulation will be applied and implemented , because openness , transparency and the provision of access to documents is an attitude which must be strengthened in our respective administrations and which must become a reality . 
i believe that many of us who are in favour of the maximum degree of transparency , which would allow the institutions to become more efficient , were truly amazed , a few years ago , to discover that , in a country which always sets an example in these areas , certain sterilisation practices had been taking place for several years , specifically in relation to certain categories of citizen , in the most shady and least transparent manner . 
i believe that this demonstrates that there are no perfect situations and that we all have to make progress in order to prevent situations of this type . 
i now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the commission from accepting certain amendments . 
one of them is the need to achieve a fair balance between openness and efficiency . 
i am referring in particular to texts for internal use and to initial drafts and preparatory study documents for exclusively internal use by the institutions . 
all national legislation in this field excludes these documents . 
i must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is the precise definition of what documents are . 
in this respect , i believe that we must now continue to make progress in seeking a common definition , on which all the institutions can agree . 
therefore , although i cannot agree to the amendments to articles 3 and 4 today , that is to say amendments nos 28 and 30, this does not mean that we do not have to hold discussions and make progress in this regard . 
we have no written document before us and , in future too , i would like the commission to inform the members of its recommendations in writing . 
i have to disagree with my colleague , mr poos . 
it is not for the commission to tell political groups what decisions they should make on the amendments that have come from the different political groups and therefore the commissioner should not be placed in this invidious position . 
mr president , i asked for the floor to make the same comment as mr poos . 
mr cashman was right to say that it is not up to the commission to tell the political groups how they should vote here in plenary . 
own funds of banks 
we welcome the enhanced status accorded to credit risk mitigation , particularly the collateral which may be offered by small businesses . 
we also accept that , in the long term , there is probably a need for a new charge for other risks , but we make the point that there should be no such charge until there is a sensible method of measuring other risks . 
we also accept that there is a need for regulators to have the power to impose particular and additional charges on particular banks . 
the new framework puts trust in banks . 
we are not allowing them to set their own capital charges but we would be getting suspiciously close to that if we did not keep a close eye on their internal systems . 
2000 / 0157 ( cod ) ] 
figueiredo ( gue / ngl ) , rapporteur . 
( pt ) mr president , i wish to inform the house that the amendments that appear under the name of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , which i have tabled in my capacity as rapporteur , are the result of discussions with the council and the commission and also have the support of the coordinators of the political groups that are represented in the committee on employment and social affairs . 
they result from the need to ease the way of the codecision procedure to which this report is subject , as you all know . 
because they keep going for split voting on so many articles when there is often only one aspect they want to vote against . 
so i would be grateful if the liberals could take a more pragmatic and speedier approach . 
mr president , it is a great shame that neither rapporteur has entered into proper consultation over this . 
we are dealing with a very important piece of legislation and with important articles . 
mr president , in the light of the excellent vote of support for this report and given the commission 's response this morning , it is obviou. if you look at all the parts we have voted o. that under rule 69 ( 2 ) we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution in order to allow us to enter into fruitful negotiations with the commission and the council . 
i hope the house will support that proposal . 
( parliament decided to postpone the vote ) 
mr president , i understand that there is now no possibility of voting on the theorin and smet reports . 
i would therefore like to recommend that the vote on these reports be postponed until the november ii part - session . 
i also put to the vote mrs theorin 's proposal to postpone the vote to the november ii part - session . 
mr president , the theorin and smet reports were debated late yesterday evening , and the intention was that we should vote on them now . 
i could agree to postponement under one condition , namely if mrs theorin used the time up to november ii to improve her report , for as it stands our group cannot endorse it . 
it is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues cannot be here in the evening . 
so , to put it in a nutshell : on behalf of my group i would agree to postpone it to november ii , if mrs theorin states that she will continue to work on her report and to improve it . 
( applause from the ppe - de group ) 
as far as the second point is concerne. namely that the votes will take place in the afternoo . i think that we are all aware of this and that we should be present . 
mr president , i apologise for saying that the group of the european people 's party and european democrats had also requested that the vote be postponed , but your coordinator in actual fact came to me and said that you also wished to postpone the issue until the november ii part - session instead of taking the vote this evening . 
mr poettering , we have worked together with your people , and the group of the european people 's party and european democrats and the group of the party of european socialists have agreed on how the report should look . 
we were united on the central issues and came to an agreement in the negotiations . 
i submit to what parliament wants to do , but it is , nevertheless , a matter of an agreement between the group of the european people 's party and european democrats and the group of the party of european socialists , concerning both my report and the central issues it contains . 
mr president , i should like to give an explanation of vote on the bse feed resolution . 
i voted against whole herd slaughter because i do not believe it is the best way to eradicate bse . 
i have heard that there are some farmers who , rather than report they have an animal with bse , shoot that animal and bury it . 
i know that in france they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward . 
even the scientific steering committee says it is not necessarily the most effective , and feed cohort slaughte. which we have in britai. is effective . 
i also voted against amendment no 7 because i do not believe it is possible , but i did vote for the resolution as a whole , especially the ban on the mammalian meat - and - bone meal feed for all farm animals , as we have had in the uk since 1996 . 
i voted for the resolution because we have to have strong rules applicable across the eu . 
mr president , i voted for the report on our great parliament 's initiative on the serious crisis in we which find ourselves due to the spread of this epidemic amongst cattle . 
i would like to point out that my intention in voting for the motion was , inter alia , to support point 7 of the report . 
indeed , i hope and call for an analysis to be carried out immediately of all the cattle carcasses which have been placed on the market in butchers ' shops throughout the european union , in order to discover whether they are infected with bse ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) . 
a check must be carried out on all the carcasses immediately , whatever the cost , for otherwise beef and veal sales will fall below zero . 
. ( el ) the commission and the council of the european union have a great deal to answer for as regards the proportions which the issue of bse has assumed . 
apart from the negativity which they demonstrated during the first stage , when the european parliament called attention to the risks in great britain , action during the second stage , when the crisis was at its height in great britain , was basically limited to that country , and there was no immediate programme of strict controls or attempt to restructure animal feedingstuffs at pan - european level . 
cases of bse have been identified in france because it was the only country in the european union which took the initiative to apply a system of extensive controls . 
today , complete uncertainty reigns in a climate of anxiety as to the risks in store , and neither consumers nor government authorities have any information on them . 
we must immediately : 
this situation shows how irresponsibly the unification of the internal market has been pursued in recent years . 
the first step we need to take is to start again from scratch , to review the labelling rules , to restore certain national controls , to create others and always to set out carefully , and in a clear and practicable manner , minimum european rules , while giving each state the essential right either to go further or to take safeguard measures . 
that is why we want to learn four major lessons which should be borne in mind for the future . 
the first lesson is that we must reject production methods that go against nature , that are doomed to lead sooner or later to tragedies of this sort . 
perhaps quality farming is a little more expensive , but the apparent savings gained by farming geared to productivity in fact end up as terrible costs for society as a whole . 
in that respect , we are appalled to see that the commission is doing all it can to re - authorise gmos , at a time when we still have no real idea of their effects and they are liable , 10 or 20 years ' hence , to cause new tragedies along the lines of mad cow disease . 
lesson number two : quality farming , which ensures a certain independence in regard to food , cannot survive in europe in the context of a global free market . 
yet at this very moment , after seattle , we feel that commissioner lamy is just itching to start up a new round of international trade negotiations , to include agriculture , with the intention of once again bringing about a fresh alignment with the world market . 
that is unacceptable . 
lesson number three : the member states must keep a closer eye on the commission during international negotiations to prevent any further false move. or should i have said betrayals. such as the blair house and marrakech agreements , which , by cutting down on our vegetable protein products for the benefit of the americans , drove us to respond by developing the meat - and - bone meal production that lies at the root of our current problems . 
we believe that , instead of giving the commission even greater powers in international negotiations , as is currently proposed , the future treaty of nice should subject the commission to closer scrutiny by the national governments and parliaments . 
lesson number four : we must radically review the policy of totally abolishing internal border controls , since it encourages trafficking of all kinds and makes health and safety controls more difficult . 
similarly , we should temper the dogma of free movement at all costs , which led the commission to threaten those states that wanted to introduce an embargo on british beef in 1996 and to drag france before the court of justice in 1999 for having refused to lift that embargo . 
that is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle . 
we have been waiting for far too long . 
the union as a whole must be involved , for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual . 
moreover , we are still , unfortunately , seeing many cases of fraud and the only way to put a stop to that is to ban meat - and - bone meal throughout the community . 
these are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them . 
the european parliament must exert pressure on the commission , which was overly cautious in the proposals it made during the debate . 
we are astounded that the commission does not seem to realise the scale of the problem . 
finally , this unprecedented crisis emphasises the limitations of the common agricultural policy , which we have seen for many years now . 
today we must help farmers not to increase their production , but to improve it . 
there too , we have been waiting for far too long . 
some people are concerned about the emergence of genetically modified products to replace meat - and - bone meal . 
the lack of consumer confidence is spreading and the agricultural markets are battening down the hatches . 
unless there is a change in the common agricultural policy , the food safety problem will only get worse . 
the cap has always promoted intensive production , the gradual ' stepping up ' of production and land concentration , which has basically served the interests of the agro - food industry and the big transnational food companies . 
the basic problem will not be solved simply by having a european food authority and belated one - off legislative measures , however positive they may be , such as the ban on meat meal in all animal feedingstuffs . 
it is crucial that we go further and promote a change in the common agricultural policy . 
the recent cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) are , i am afraid , condemning confirmation of the union 's delays in tackling food safety , delays which are even more to be condemned if we consider that the use of meat - and - bone meal in feedingstuffs has been considered dangerous for some tim. it was condemned by this house a long time ag. and yet no measures have been taken . 
it is therefore necessary to establish as soon as possible the procedures to prevent the use of anatomical parts liable to lead to the transmission of the virus . 
the commission 's proposals contained in the white paper on food safety and , in particular , the establishment of the authority which is to guarantee this safety , must be implemented as soon as possibl. over a year has passed and the authority is not yet operativ. in order to avoid the confusion of actions carried out by the governments on the subject causing damage such as that which we are witnessing now . 
the damage is extremely serious in that it affects two strictly related areas : human health , on the one hand , and , on the other , the health of the cattle species and , consequently , the economy of the zootechnical sector . 
we should remember that europe banned france from continuing to enforce the embargo on beef and veal from the united kingdom and that the lack of measures has allowed the epidemic now to spread to france . 
it is , nevertheless , necessary for the commission to ban the use of meat - and - bone meal henceforth and to provide fo. as far as is know. safer procedures to destroy the parts considered dangerous such as the brain and bone marrow . 
until we are given more information by the scientific bodies , it would be appropriate to destroy the cattle carcasses as well to provide the highest possible guarantee of the protection of human health . 
the cases of bse which have arisen in france , in the same way as the dioxins in chickens issue in belgium , are the latest in a long series of irresponsible incidents . 
for fear of spreading panic among the citizens or with a view to avoiding commercial disasters , certain governments did not provide the commission with the necessary information quickly enough or did not immediately call a halt to consumption of the products in question or ban their export at the first signs of danger . 
these irresponsible attitudes must be strongly condemned and , to avoid these incidents reoccurring , appropriate regulations must be established for all the states of the union . 
it is unthinkable that we should be trying to run a single market without common rules for such a major sector as that of public health . 
in the face of these uncertainties , the citizens ' reaction is , rightly , one of fear and the refusal to consume those products which are suspected of being dangerous for health . 
this attitude is combined with lack of confidence in the european union , which appears to the citizens not to be able to guarantee the safety of the foodstuffs on the market . 
let me point to the key role the uen group , and also the very coherent draft resolution we tabled , played in ensuring that it took place . 
we finally agreed to co - sign the joint draft resolution and we are delighted it was adopted by a very large majority , despite its inadequacies and weaknesses . 
because of the inability of all the european institutions , the council , the commission and parliament , to define an appropriate community policy that responds to the safety needs of the member states most directly concerned , problems will arise in deciding whether it is the constraints of the single market or the health and safety needs of our people that come first . 
how , indeed , can we restore consumer confidence in france and prevent the collapse of the sectors linked to stock - farming if , on the one hand , we put a total ban on the use of meat - and - bone meal by french farmers while at the same time authorising imports of meat from member states that continue to feed their animals with meat - and - bone meal and refuse to carry out tests ? 
i voted for this directive but i would like to stress that , in doing so , i am calling upon the european union to commit itself and concern itself , rightly , with those who breathe the toxic air produced by these industrial activities . it must als. and even more s. concern itself with those who work in these sectors . 
i feel that it would be appropriate to reduce the working hours of the people who work in pollutant companies . 
for if these companies pollute the air outside , i hate to think about the state of the air inside the factories ! 
. ( fr ) we have now reached the end of a long process leading to the adoption of a directive on the incineration of waste . 
the commission proposal goes back to 1998, but , because of the many points of disagreement between parliament and the council , the conciliation committee had to be convened on 11 october . 
so today we are deciding on the text that has emerged from the conciliation procedure . 
let me remind you that the directive covers the incineration and co - incineration of waste . 
these two treatment methods must form part of a global strategy that covers the prevention , re - use and recycling of waste , a strategy that is coordinated at european level . 
in the course of the debates that marked the two readings by the european parliament , i expressed my doubts and fears about lumping hazardous and non - hazardous waste together in the same directive . 
these are very legitimate concerns and they have led parliament to be very vigilant and to table amendments aimed at establishing very stringent controls over everything connected with the process of incineration and co - incineration . 
after extensive discussion with the council , we achieved what we wanted on several points . 
the european parliament has been to the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years . 
i support the objective of the directive which we are discussing here today which is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels into the air of several major pollutants . 
this is also part of broader european union environmental policies which are designed to reduce the use of pollutants across all economic sectors in europe , in accordance with obligations laid down by the kyoto accord . 
the european union fully supports the strict , ambitious but attainable recycling and recovery targets that have been laid down by the irish government . 
these targets which are to be achieved over the next 15 years include the following : a divergence of 50 % of overall household waste from landfill sites ; a minimum 65 % reduction in bio - degradable waste which is presently consigned to landfill sites ; the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally beneficial technologies capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of bio - degradable waste per annum . 
all these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management . 
the days of landfill sites are now coming to an end and must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies . 
figueiredo report ( a5 - 0307 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the figuereido report on the eradication of social exclusion and poverty , to quote the actual text of the report . 
however , i am amazed and extremely disappointed at many of the votes cast regarding some of the amendments . 
i am absolutely convinced that 99 % of the responsibility for social exclusion and poverty lies with the governments of our 15 states . 
in the past , they have all vied with each other to increase social exclusion and poverty and they are continuing to do so now . 
if indeed , for example , pensions were less inadequate in terms of the standard of living they allow , there would be fewer poor people . 
group of the european people 's party , why did you vote against the fatuzzo amendmen. tabled by mysel. which stated that poverty is also one of the causes of low pensions ? 
i am extremely disappointed and i hope that you will vote differently next time . 
this figure of 65 million poor is not the effect of some misfortune that has come out of the blue ; it is the result of the greed of a privileged capitalist class intent on boosting company profits and stock exchange rates , which therefore makes people redundant , closes down factories , reducing 15 million women and men to unemployment , and puts such pressure on all wages that the lowest wages are not enough to live on . 
the report proposes a budget of eur 100 million over five years to combat poverty . 
that comes to one and a half euros for every poor european . 
even as a handout that would be derisory , quite apart from the fact that the issue of poverty does not call for charity . 
we realise that no report and no vote , even by the european parliament , can alter this situation . 
yet the report could at least have put the blame at the door of those responsible . 
in any case , though we did not vote against the report , we did not feel able to vote in favour of it either , because not only are its practical proposals inadequate but , alas , it conceals rather than combats the actual situation , namely the exploitation that is the real cause of poverty among the working classes . 
. ( fr ) this programme to combat social exclusion is one of the priorities of the french presidency , which has made the social europe the leitmotif of its proposals . 
let me remind you that lisbon defined a common strategy of social inclusion . 
i welcome this initiative , which responds to the expectations of our fellow citizens , the citizens of europe . 
indeed , while we welcome the return to growth and the fall in unemployment , we must not close our eyes to the fact that inequalities are still with us , if not getting worse . 
social exclusion is a very real phenomenon , as the eurostat statistics show : some 18 % of the population of the european union lives on less than 60 % of the average national incom. this is the low - income threshold taken to measure relative povert. which means that 65 million people live on low incomes . 
even though the unemployment rate has fallen , there are still 16 million unemployed in the european union . 
moreover , although unemployment is still the main factor behind poverty and exclusion , job insecurity and low pay are nonetheless obstacles to full integration into society . 
too many of our fellow - citizens are left by the wayside . 
we must therefore adopt proactive measures to provide social protection and access to public services in the field of health , education , housing and so on . 
i unreservedly support the proposal to implement a second luxembourg process to deal with social exclusion , containing guidelines and national action programmes . 
indeed , we can see all the benefits of this method in the employment field . 
the lisbon european council set the european union the objective of becoming a knowledge - based , competitive and inclusive society . 
ireland has quite an advanced system of social and employment rights and many eu directives are being drafted , particularly on the irish model in the field of social partnership and employee / employer relations . 
-- ( fr ) there is 18 % of the population of europe , or 60 million people , living on less than 60 % of the average national income ( the low - income threshold used to measure relative poverty ) . 
simply mentioning these figures ought to drive us to act , which is what the heads of state and government did in lisbon by entering poverty and exclusion on the european agenda for the first time . 
since europe cannot be economically strong without social justice , we can only welcome this progress . 
the report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established . 
it is fundamental within the 15 states of the european union for us all to able to speak of the same thing on the basis of identical data . 
moreover , the report calls on the member states to be more proactive and set precise objectives when they draw up their national action plans . 
finally , the report goes back to the open method of coordination , calling for dialogue between the players involved ( social partners , ngos , local and regional authorities ) and networking . 
in conclusion , our committee on social affairs , is proposing a budget of eur 100 million instead of the eur 70 proposed by the commission . 
all in all , this is a step forward that we must consolidate and encourage , since economic progress by itself can certainly not guarantee the citizens a better quality of life . 
-- ( fr ) this report has the merit of revealing the true face of european integration today : 62 million poor and 18 million unemployed . 
the ongoing restructuring processes and mergers involve new redundancy plans . 
although we are seeing strong economic growth and a fall in unemployment , in the modern world work offers no protection against exclusion . 
the ' working poor ' , most of them women , working part - time , for a pittance and in the most insecure jobs , join the trail of poverty so loftily ignored in the official speeches about economic recovery . 
quality jobs , health care , housing and education are indeed basic rights , which , if they were binding upon employers and states , would be able to offer protection against social exclusion . 
that is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion . 
the open method of coordination is emphasised which respects the principle of subsidiarity whilst actively involving all relevant actors . 
we are sadly all too familiar with the spider 's web of problems impoverished areas fac. deprivation , social exclusion , unemployment , crime and drug abuse , but with the help of european schemes tackling social exclusion and european cash , local communities can begin to free themselves from this evil tangle . 
the british labour government has been leading the fight against poverty and social exclusion . 
three years ago , the prime minister set up the social exclusion unit which coordinates government action to reduce social exclusion by producing joined up solutions to joined up problems . 
it works with other departments which have a close bearing on social exclusion . 
i fully endorse this innovative measure that has benefited many young people in particular , through strong action on truancy and school exclusion , sleeping rough , teenage pregnancy and providing support to 16 - 18 year olds not in education , employment or training . 
this is a great example of the labour government delivering concrete benefits to ordinary people . 
with a new , radical approach , i strongly believe that we can , not only turn the corner , but reach the finishing line too and , one day , banish poverty and social exclusion from the north - west entirely . 
rothe report ( a5 - 0320 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i abstained from the vote for one specific reason : in my opinion , this report has not made the environmental progress that i hoped and called for . 
i did vote for all the amendments intended to increase alternative energy sources , but i had hoped that we would be able to take a further step forward . 
i know that it is difficult , i know that this report has , in any case , adopted the right line , but further endeavours are necessary and , to this end , i call for this alternative energy policy to be pursued more vigorously . 
mr president , with the rothe repor. at least with the interventionist aid system for renewable energy sources that it describe. we are about to make mistakes in energy policy , which will have a very serious impact on europe in the long term . 
that is why i rejected the report . 
energy policy must look to the future , be sustainable and respect market principles . 
what the report seeks is precisely the opposite . 
the policy of constantly subsidising wind , biomass and solar energy is mistaken and purely symbolic . 
billions are paid out in subsidies to the few who are ruining the countryside with their wind turbines . 
we now have a plant with more than 60 rotors , taking up as much land as 1000 football pitches . 
-- ( fr ) during last night 's plenary debate , many of us spoke of the need to promote renewable energy sources at a time when the conference on climate change is being held in the hague . 
indeed , scientists and climatologists are increasingly less worried about hiding their fears in relation to the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions , and even the general public is starting to become aware of them . 
these projections , which are dramatic in the very short term , should convince us of the need to adopt clear , proactive measures at european level targeted at checking this process of degradation in the quality of the environment . 
the commission proposal and the rothe report we voted for today follow that line in calling for the promotion of renewable energy sources , which are alternative sources that respect the environment in the production of electricity . 
this follows up the statements by the commission and the call from the european parliament for major progress to be made towards implementing the target set out in the white paper of doubling the share of renewable energy in energy consumption by the year 2020 . 
the member states must now pursue the same line and respect the environmental objectives they endorsed both at european level and at international level , but they must also ensure their independence as regards energy and security of supplies . 
at present , the union is dependent on outside supplies for about 50 % of its energy , and that figure may well rise to 70 % by the year 2020 unless we develop renewable energy sources . 
today the european union is leading the way in the construction of plants for the various types of energy production . 
if the union wants to remain competitive in this sector , it will have to contribute by using and developing the technologies concerned , which implies major public funding . 
for all these reasons , and because the rothe report is an excellent report , i voted for it in the hope that the commission and the council will follow us . 
in finland peat is an important renewable energy source , and accounts for 6 % of all fuel used . 
unlike in central europe , there is a lot of peat in the nordic countries such as finland . 
specialists worldwide have also said that peat is an important biomass fuel , whose annual growth clearly exceeds its consumption in finland . 
the northernmost areas of finland are in the tundra zone , where not enough wood grows to constitute a source of natural energy . 
peat is an important fuel particularly in these regions , where it also has an important impact on employment . 
i am satisfied that the european parliament recognises these facts and includes peat in its report on renewable energy sources . 
the member states of the european union , including finland , are committed to achieving the kyoto targets , conservation of natural resources and a reduction in emissions of harmful substances . 
a first step here is consistently to break down all obstacles to the use of renewables . 
moreover , in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public . 
secondly , the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption , for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs . 
in that regard , we call for more targeted research into the external costs of the production and use of renewable energy sources . 
lastly , we can only restructure energy supplies if we take account of the special conditions pertaining to alternative energy suppliers . 
decentralised electricity provision is not just a structural but also a social aspect . 
thirdly , therefore , we must not liberalise the energy sector without defining minimum social standards . 
. ( nl ) we cannot carry on producing electricity from the customary sources . 
coal and oil supplies will eventually run out and are responsible for co2 emission . 
nuclear energy can cause disasters capable of rendering large parts of the earth uninhabitable , and produces a hazardous waste product . 
so we must go in search of energy that is already present in nature , but which has remained unused because no one has developed the technology to tap into it . 
it is not very ambitious of parliament and the commission to only want to double the use of this form of energy over the decade to come . 
there is still too little water , wind and solar power , which is what makes it comparatively expensive . 
everyone wants a method of electricity production that is as environmentally - friendly as possible , but they also want it as cheaply as possible . 
the central american parliament appears to have recently been the subject of certain misunderstandings and even criticism . 
we received a delegation from that parliament and made a commitment to improving the political profile not only of its role in that part of the world but also of relations between our parliament and the central american parliament . 
the three reasons are as follows : firstly , because it promotes the process of the consolidation of democracy and the deepening of the demand for human rights to be respected , particularly in relation to indigenous populations . 
secondly , because it coincides with the tenth latin american summit , which will take place shortly in panama , and which will deal with commitments to children and young people on the basis of justice and equality in the new millennium . 
thirdly , because it also coincides with the current philosophy of the european commission in favour of redirecting union external action towards the countries of latin america with the potential impact that this may have . 
i remember very well that mr salafranca signed a document with the president of parlacen on political dialogue between the two parliaments . 
we saw that parlacen was going through the same changes that this parliament went through at the beginning , since it had to fight and continues to fight to have more competences , more resources and more presence and to be recognised as representative . 
i believe that this is one of the central themes of the debates at every interparliamentary conference , along with the economic and social difficulties experienced by some of the countries of central america and south america . 
two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area , which would be beneficial to all . 
that is the purpose of this resolution . 
we believe that , not only now but since parlacen was born , there are people who wish it to have fewer competences and less of a presence , because a parliament always creates discomfort , but i believe that the vocation of parlacen , and of this and other parliaments , is to be of benefit to the people it represents , even if this may make the established powers feel uncomfortable . 
i therefore hope , mr president , that this resolution will be approved by a large majority . 
this is the approach of the report , an own - initiative report , which we in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy are going to produce in conjunction with the competent delegations . 
mr president , parliament. as you and all of us in parliament know very wel. have today , more than ever , the difficult task , amongst others , of showing leadership in the development of our societies , of leading the quest for solutions to the many problems facing us by strengthening the values of democracy and social justice which we stand for . 
in the case of the central american parliament , this task is , if possible , even more important given the enormous challenge of the integration and structural development of these societies on the basis of peace , dialogue and reconciliation . 
on the basis of its shared roots , it must discover the broad range of its possible courses of development and the multiple possibilities that its project presents , by opting for peace , freedom and solidarity and also by responding to the age - old requirement of self knowledge . 
i therefore believe that we have to flatly reject the self - interested criticisms of those people who brand the activity of the central american parliament an artificial system and accuse it of being a cardboard parliament which is hollow and devoid of substance . 
this is one of those questions on which we all feel practically the same , not only in this house but also amongst those many members who , as result of our own origins , view with great sympathy the processes of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries which we consider to be our own . 
i agree with the words of the honourable member from the canary islands coalition insofar as we show our support for parlacen because of its importance in terms of the consolidation of democratic structures and , therefore , we , as the european parliament , must stand united with an institution such as that . 
i do not share the reservations expressed by our honourable member , the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of central america and mexico , mr seguro , with regard to the issue of human rights . 
you can change the language if you like , but not the intention . 
i believe that on these issues we have to continue to preach at home what we want to happen throughout the world , without averting our eyes when human rights are trampled underfoot in other parts of the world . 
in any event , i would like to express my conviction that we must ensure that actions take over from words . 
in relation to cooperation with latin america , actions are the most effective possible yardstick , from ou. that is , spain ' . point of view . 
mr president , the commission takes note of the proposals for resolutions tabled by parliament on respect for human rights in central america , the process of democratisation and regional integration , and on the special importance which you attach to the role of the central american parliament . 
the commission follows the situation in the region with great interest and our priority objectives in our relations with the region focus on the three points which you have highlighted : respect for human rights , the consolidation of the democratic process and the strengthening of regional integration . 
in this context , the commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas . 
with regard to human rights , we have , since 1990, been supporting the cooperation programmes in favour of respect for human rights by means of education and raising awareness in this area . 
you are well aware that between 1990 and 2000 eur 65 million has been spent on this activity , which we continue to support with a view to the future . 
for the next multiannual programme , which will begin soon , we are considering an additional contribution of more than eur 10 million in order to continue this activity . 
mr president , for a long time côte d ' ivoire stood out as a pillar of stability and relative prosperity in the tormented life of west africa . 
that is why we were so disturbed and sad to see the slow political , economic and human ruination of this country , orchestrated by the military junta of general gueï . 
in order to hold on to power , general gueï hijacked the constitution adopted by the people of côte d ' ivoire for his sole benefit and used it as a means of excluding his political opponents . 
in order to hold on to power , he did not hesitate to exploit the bitter debate on ivoirian nationality , sparking an explosion of xenophobia : hatred of others , of foreigners , whether from burkina faso or mali , even though so many of them have lived and worked in the country for many years . 
in this way he has brought côte d ' ivoire to the brink of civil and ethnic war . 
but the ivoirian people did not allow the junta to play their murderous game to the bitter end : they forced the tyrant to flee and , by electing a long - standing opponent , laurent gbagbo , to rule the country , they brought côte d ' ivoire back onto the track of democracy . 
now this process needs to be confirmed rapidly by the organisation of free , transparent and pluralist legislative elections in which all the political forces can take part . 
at least , that is what both the political leaders and the people are calling for today . 
that is precisely the point of our resolution . 
the extreme confusion that has characterised the electoral process over recent weeks in côte d ' ivoire , which had looked like a model economy until now , is symptomatic of a country in crisis , reflected by an economy in crisis , social despair and , consequently , political chaos . 
the real issues and national debates were overshadowed by the spurious yet contentious debate about ivoirian nationality . 
if the parliamentary elections in december do not proceed in a fair manner then the unrest will undoubtedly flare up again . 
after all , the violence of recent times has left the people with deep scars . 
if there is even the slightest political lapse their anger will take hold again . 
it is therefore absolutely essential that the parliamentary elections due to take place in december , proceed fairly , and needless to say , exclusion for reasons of ethnicity is absolutely out of the question . 
côte d ' ivoire will only be able to regain its stability if the new rulers are prepared to engage in power - sharing . 
it is also impossible to envisage lasting peace in the country without religious and ethnic tolerance . 
the political , military and religious leaders must pull out all the stops to make national reconciliation possible . 
what is needed is a constitution which guarantees the rights of the citizens and the political parties and rules out abuse of power . 
first of all , i believe the european union should welcome the fact that the new president , laurent gbagbo , is setting up a national reconciliation committee . 
we must also welcome the organisation of legislative elections next month , but we must insist that these elections are transparent and do not exclude any political force or any candidate . 
equality between the political movements must be guaranteed . 
in the same way , i believe that the 14 parties that have been excluded must be reintegrated and play a full part in these elections . 
otherwise it would mean that when someone like mr ouattara is excluded , second - class citizenship is de facto being introduced , and there would be two kinds of citizens and discrimination would eventually become established as a state system . 
let me finish by saying this : dictatorships come into being only because there are people who are destitute and who have no access to learning , no access to knowledge . 
so from that point of view i believe that it is essential that we urgently target our aid for those countries , in order to help them move towards a democratic system , at combating illiteracy , poverty and destitution . 
it is at that price and by giving assistance to these people that we will finally help them to set up a democratic system . 
mr president , it is tempting to present the recent political events in côte d ' ivoire as the victory of democracy over dictatorship , as a repeat performance of the belgrade scenario , but this time taking place in the heart of west africa . 
it is tempting , but it would be wrong , because the reality is rather more complex and the position of the new president is quite a lot more controversial . 
naturally we welcome the fact that junta leader gueï failed in his scheme to legitimise his power through sham elections . 
the european union , and also this parliament , made an important contribution to this by demanding that democratic elections take place and instituting the suspension procedure . 
but that still does not give laurence gbagdo , who won the elections , the legitimacy he needs . 
after all , he drew the nationalist card too . 
he also supported the amendment to the constitution , with the intention of cutting out his most significant opponent , watara , on the grounds that one of his parents is not an ivoirian national . 
this law led to the serious disruption of traditional ethnic harmony in côte d ' ivoire . 
fearing a civil war , watara reconciled himself to the result . 
it would not be illogical for the european union to immediately demand new presidential elections , in which all candidates would be able to participate this time round . 
but i recognise that there are a number of reasons for not doing so . 
after all , against this background , he offered his opponents various ministerial posts and declared 9 november a national day of mourning . 
conversely , all the parties have now declared themselves willing to help to restore the constitutional state and peace . 
the unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200, which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime . 
but we must also say that the day of reconciliation on 9 november will send out new signals in regard to establishing democracy and the rule of law and taking seriously the demand for national reconciliation . 
the european union has been asked , and has declared itself prepared , to help ensure that the elections in december , as well as the local elections in january , are conducted in a peaceful , fair , free and transparent manner . 
these elections must enable the political parties that were excluded from the presidential election to be represented at national level and thereby compensate , though only partially , for the defects of that first election . 
these elections should make up one of the key elements of the national reconciliation that we all wish to see and are calling for . 
the european community will provide financial support for these elections to be held , and we will also cooperate by providing some one hundred observers . 
mr president , commissioner , when thursdays arrive and we deal with the situation of human rights in the world , i am put in mind , to some extent , of what the wailing wall must be like . 
its sad inheritance of colonialism and neo - colonialism obliges the european union to take a firm , very brave and decisive stance , in order to aid the re - establishment of democracy in various parts of the world , such as latin america , which currently faces the problem of guatemala with its fight against the impunity of military figures , africa or , in this case , burma . 
as has been said , the truth is that the situation in burma is getting worse ; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as aung san suu kyi and that the democratic league cannot operate normally in its work for the re - establishment of democracy , especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom , that lack of union rights there . 
i , too , reluctantly welcome the opportunity to debate our concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in burma and , like many before me , i would have preferred that the situation there had improved so that we did not have to keep returning to this issue over and over again . 
i hope that , by prioritising this issue as an urgency , this parliament is giving a clear message to the burmese people that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in burma is worsening rather than improving and are determined to try and do something about it . 
however , i do believe that the international community needs to move on from rhetoric to real action and , as a member of parliament 's delegation for relations with the member states of asean , south - east asia and the republic of korea , i am disappointed and concerned like others before me that the eu has decided to enter into dialogue with asean in laos next month at ministerial level . 
you feel like telling those old men to open the door and success will flood in . 
instead , we see a complete lack of press freedom and ongoing political oppression . 
just look at how the dissident ha is phu was treated . 
i am fully aware that the vietnam debate is historically charged . 
we must be careful what we say about vietnam , or at least that has been customary hitherto . 
after all , the west has had a certain level of involvement in the country . 
that is what prevents the country from taking off ; it is what prevents it from effectively combating the corruption which blights it . 
these slight improvement. which we certainly do not owe to the author of the socialist group amendments , mr sakellario. have come about over the last few years and given rise to a situation that is certainly no longer tragic but that remains disastrous and in any case still is no match for the real issues of modern - day vietnam . 
the commission must therefore take resolute action to ensure that the question of democracy , the question of the rule of law , becomes the key to the european union 's relations with vietnam . 
so i believe this is an important resolution . 
we adopted a resolution two years ago , the most recent one on vietnam , and there , too , i do not remembe. nor do i think mr posselt remember. the socialist group giving any particular undertaking to support that resolution at the time . 
we adopted the resolution and we have had occasion to note that it brought about a few small improvements . 
i hope that after this resolution is adopte. without mr sakellariou 's amendment. we will hear a firm undertaking from the commission and a few practical responses from the vietnamese authorities . 
mr president , i agree in many important respects with the previous speakers , because much of what is happening in vietnam today is unacceptable . 
mr president , with your permission i will misuse a little of my speaking time and draw attention to a case which could not be included in the list of urgencies because it only recently became known . 
in iran , two individuals , said sadr and khalil rostamchani , have been threatened with the death penalty , or at least the public prosecutor has applied for it , in a case relating to an event held by the heinrich böll foundation in berlin after the elections . 
israel is probably one of the most obvious examples in world history of the fact that it is not so simple . 
every nation must learn over and over again what democracy and human rights are . 
now , however , human rights watch , as mr swoboda mentioned , is saying that vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights . 
tens of thousands of political prisoners have been released . 
i think that is it appropriate for such a thing to be mentioned in a resolution . 
we must be harsh in our criticism , but we must not ignore what is nevertheless being done . 
this only weakens the criticism , and those who are being criticised get the feeling that it is of no avail what they d. if they do not do everything at once , which is something they neither can nor want to do . 
criticism can be counterproductive if it does not take into account what has actually been done . 
vietnam deserves harsh criticism of the kind reflected in the motion for a resolutio. there is no doubt about tha. but i think that it is appropriate for us also to include a few sentences demonstrating that we are aware that certain improvements have been made . 
the war between these two countries has not led to lasting bitterness . 
it would be better still though , if the president were not just to concentrate on reinforcing mutual cooperation , when he visits hanoi , but if he were to make this very cooperation conditional on the extraction of firm promises from vietnam to drastically improve the prevailing lamentable human rights situation . 
for there is certainly a great deal amiss in communist vietnam . 
contrary to amendment no 1 tabled by the pse group , i noted in a document published on 10 november , that human rights watch regards the human rights situation as being grave on quite a number of counts . 
the most recent edition of the asian weekly ' far east and economic review ' today refers to the existence of top secret documents originating from vietnam . 
these extremely secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of vietnamese government policy . 
closer examination of these official paper . i have read them mysel. reveals that the protestants are the main target of persecution . 
what is telling about this is the promotion of a district official whose fury has driven hundreds of christians to take flight . 
this persecutor of churches has been asked by the powers that be to cleanse not just his own province , but also the entire district , of christians . 
the lie has now been exposed . 
after all , the vietnamese government claims to have introduced freedom of worship in recent years . 
president clinton would do well to raise this matter during his present visit to hanoi . 
i urge the council and the commission to protest in robust terms against this flagrant abuse of freedom of worship by the vietnamese authorities . 
mr president , i will try to speak about both issues . 
he also expressed his concern about the detention and harassment of aung san suu kyi and the members of the national league for democracy . 
we in the commission fully share your concerns about this situation and we agree wholeheartedly with the numerous criticisms expressed here today of the way in which the military regime usually makes a mockery of each and every principle contained in the universal declaration of human rights . 
the resolution recently adopted by the united nations demonstrates that it is not only the european union that harbours these concerns . 
however , that does not mean that , either now or in december , we should behave as if the accession of myanmar to asean had not affected our relations , because it has . 
our asean partners know this very well and are concerned to repair this damage ; on the other hand , they know that encouraging burma to make a genuine effort and to put an end to its appalling behaviour in the field of human rights is the best way to revive relations between the union and asean . 
given the importance that both they and we attach to these relations , we hope that our asean partners will continue to communicate our concern. which we believe the majority of them shar. in relation to the military regime . 
i believe that the european union - asean ministerial meeting should be taken as a new opportunity to clearly and firmly express our opinions on the situation prevailing in burma , both to the regime itself as well as to the members of asean . 
we will therefore exert pressure on the military regime to put an end to the violations of human rights and begin a dialogue with the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . 
with regard to the issue of vietnam and the human rights situation , i would like to point out the following : we must remember that vietnam is a country in transition , that its government initiated a process which led to the adoption in 1986 of a reform programme that embraced external relations and political and economic change . 
i fully share the concern about the problems raised by some members : although it is true that almost 23 000 people have already been freed as a result of general amnesties , we must continue to show concern for those are still in prison for their political or religious beliefs . 
it is a source of satisfaction that there is no official censorship in the vietnamese press , but it is also absolutely clear that there is occasional censorship in the foreign press . 
there is also clear pressure from the vietnamese authorities for their own press to operate a system of self - censorship . 
furthermore , although it is to be welcomed that there has recently been a reduction in crimes punishable by the death penalty , it is clearly the case that , in our view , the death penalty should be abolished completely . 
mr president , unlike many others who will be speaking this afternoon , i do not have many constituents who suffered horrendously from flooding in the uk . 
luckily , london escaped with small - scale floods , partly from rivers we had forgotten still existed because we run them through culverts . 
we also require the eu to give help and assistance , not just in the southwest but across all of the areas that have been affected . 
the resolution calls on the commission and the member states to waste no time in expressing their support in practical ways by marshalling workers and equipment under the five - year plan establishing a community action programme in the field of civil protection which was adopted on 9 december 1999 . 
last monday jan pronk , holland 's environment minister , stated that the effect of climate change is irreversible for ecosystems , agriculture , water supply and health . 
the less we do and the longer we wait to tackle the root of the problem , the more serious the effects and the greater the strain on the resilience of peoples , plants and animals . 
this is undoubtedly true . 
the issues that are being discussed are for the medium and long - term . 
however , this resolution tabled right across parliament , including by my colleagues from england , deals with a very real and short - term problem faced by thousands and thousands of people in britain and across europe . 
the other problem i would like to raise is the additional burden that the victims of these particular tragedies will also experience , the point mentioned by my colleague , mr deva , namely the refusal of many insurance companies to continue insurance cover . 
i wonder whether or not we , as a union , could force these insurance companies under existing law to discharge what are essentially moral obligations , rather than do as they do at present and cherry pick and prefer a no - risk situation . 
however , if we cannot force them to do that then it is an area into which member state governments must step , to see whether or not it is possible , under the umbrella of the eu , to oblige member state governments to provide state cover . 
it is not fair that people should experience tragedies of this proportion and then face a very uncertain future when , given the climatic changes already taking place , there is an absolute certainty that the problems they have experienced over the last couple of weeks will recur , if not next year , then certainly in the years that follow . 
mr president , commissioner , the floods which have affected various areas of northern italy and other european countries such as the united kingdom , spain , ireland and france in recent weeks once again raise the issue for parliament both of an extraordinary , urgent intervention to alleviate the distress of the people , communities and companies affected , and a longer term policy to prevent the repetition of natural disasters of this scale . 
certain regions of italy have suffered particularly badly for the second time in less than a month . 
the damage is considerable this time as well , people have died and the material damage has been enormous . 
in liguria , in particular , entire plantations of specialised flower and fruit and vegetable crops have been destroyed and there has been a great deal of damage to seaside resorts , civil engineering works and factories , caused by storm surges as well as the floods . 
we agree with a number of assertions already made to the effect that we are in this way contributing to the protection of the environment and to the credibility of the environmental protocols with a view to their ratification in 2002 . 
the energy and transport sectors produce 85 % of the total emissions of greenhouse gases in the european union . 
it is therefore these industries which ought to be making a major effort to reduce emissions . 
given its anticipated continuous growt. of more than 38 % in the next decad. the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures . 
we are therefore entirely sympathetic to acting right now within the legal and budgetary margins available to us . 
thank you , commissioner . 
mr president , since you have already exhausted the possibilities for points of order , this probably is not one . 
. ( el ) health is a blessing , not a commodity which can comply with the rules of competition . 
in its drive towards further liberalisation , the commission is endeavouring to pave the way for new arrangements in the health and medical care sector which broaden the scope of activity of insurance companies and remove any obstacles to the business of private insurance companies at national and community level . 
the åu attaches greater importance to the principle of the free provision of services than to the right to heath and medical care , methodically and systematically undermining the public health system , especially in the medical care sector , by disgracefully promoting private forms of insurance as a ' necessary ' complement to and / or substitute for the public - sector system of social protection . 
this is a breach of absolutely fundamental principles of solidarity on which the european social model ought to be based , and a common initiative ought therefore to be taken to ensure that no one is excluded from such supplementary schemes . 
if the european parliament is asking the commission to produce an inventory of the member states ' policies , it is precisely because we have a common interest in all member states having access to high - quality health services . 
the better the health services provided by the member states , the less need there is for supplementary insurance . 
for the rest , this opens the door wide to private insurers , on condition only that they do not ( from the outset ) select the patient and the insurance premiums by type of disease . 
in fact , the aim of this resolution is merely to organise the insurance market , whereas we should instead be organising europe and moving it in the direction of encouraging high - quality collective schemes accessible to all . 
. ( de ) we are dealing again with an own - initiative report by the committee on employment and social affairs , which , although supplementary health insurance is a highly topical issue , is not totally endorsed by the committee or here in the plenary of the european parliament since , after all , 12 members did not vote for it in committee . 
it is all very well to call on the commission to present a green paper indicating ways in which the existing health insurance systems could be effectively supplemented and maintained by means of supplementary care schemes while providing high - quality medical care , and it is important that we should welcome the development of a single market for supplementary health insurance . 
but let me specially emphasise the accuracy of the statement that all other health protection should be a matter for member states rather than the european union and that publicly funded healthcare systems should remain , as ever , within the exclusive competence of the member states . 
because that is so , i think it is premature to incorporate in this resolution a long and very detailed list of points to be included in a proposal for a commission directive . 
i find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the commission 's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive , while at the same calling on it to present a green paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes . 
are we not putting the cart before the horse ? 
notwithstanding these observations and reservations , i voted for the report . 
. ( nl ) health insurance and pensions ought to form part of the remuneration people receive from their work . 
supplementary arrangements should only be necessary if the real provisions fall short of the mark . 
they are a source of profit for banks and insurance companies , which rake the money in that people save from reductions in premiums and taxes . 
instead of regarding health insurance as part of remuneration for work or as part of payments replacing wages , increasingly , this provision is being made dependent on savings and investments . 
there is a feeling that collectivity and solidarity should be done away with so that everything can be settled on an individual basis . 
everyone is being compelled just to think of their own interests , and to start attending to all kinds of unnecessary financial matters . 
people who do not earn or spend much no longer count for anything . 
one of the things this will do is create a divide in health care . 
people who have ordinary health insurance will end up on waiting lists and receiving second - rate care , whilst those who pay extra will be able to buy the right to priority treatment and luxury . 
it surprises me that rapporteur rocar. whom as i recall , was the leader of a leftwing socialist party in the dim and distant pas. is now delighted about the development of an internal market for private health care . 
the remainder of his proposals serve to dress the wounds that this option will cause . 
we are asking the commission to look at the various national health schemes and to examine ways of ensuring a fair deal for those who spend time working in another eu country . 
these national provisions are life - saving measures . 
however , if we are to have an effective system that can cope with increasing pressure on existing national services , and that makes europe a healthier place for our citizens , then we should also recognise the importance of supplementary insurance providers . 
at international level , the proposal from the basel committee to classify risks mainly on the basis of the results of ratings by external institutions would lead to considerable distortions of competition . 
it would create especially serious competitive disadvantages for medium - sized businesses . 
to prevent such distortions , it is therefore most important for the institutions to have a simple , alternative means at their disposal for identifying their own funds requirements , in fact one based on the use of internal ratings . 
it should be regarded as a success that the european position , as proposed from the outset by the commission in its consultation paper , prevailed in basel , so that the inclusion of internal rating procedures is now at the centre of the debate . 
we are in favour of matching the own capital held to cover credit risks more closely with the economic risk level and further developing the rules on own funds . 
we are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques ; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the basel committee . 
the basel committee 's proposals only concern the large banks and external rating , while we believe it is necessary to broaden them to cover the small banks and to include internal rating . 
we must ensure that the level of risk is assessed , and not just credit in the abstract , i.e. that we leave some room for manoeuvre in relation to small loans for small and medium - sized businesses and craft firms . 
i believe it is important that we also make it clear that what is going on in basel is an undemocratic procedure , that the european parliament is the only democratically legitimate organisation that is adopting a position on this in europe . 
during the procedure we must not think about whether we are surrendering rights , but about the degree of detail to which we regulate matters in europe in future , or where we should simply establish the framework and pass on certain instruments of adjustment to other institutions , such as the commission , but also basel . 
i also call on the european central bank and the commission to take great care in basel to ensure that basel takes account of the structure of the european systems . 
today we in the european parliament must also send out the signal that we will not allow our established systems to be put at risk and that the large banks will also face problems if a legal framework is created in europe . 
what we need is sufficient flexibility in this area . 
mr president , in the first place , i would point out that the commission is pleased to see that mrs villiers ' report relates not only to the evaluation of the own resources directive but also to the current revision of the changes to the regulations concerning capital adequacy . 
we also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process . 
the reaction to the two consultation documents on this subjec. that of the european commission and that of the basel committee on banking supervisio. has been positive , and i should like to comment on the latter document . 
i appreciate that the capacity of the basel committee on banking supervision has nothing to do with that of the european parliament . 
it has no legislative power , but nor should it be forgotten that it is a matter of actual fact that the basel committee on banking supervision belongs to the group of the ten and that , even though it is not a legislative body , its standards apply in 130 countries and are used by a multiplicity of international organisations , including the world bank , the international monetary fund and , obviously , third countries . 
it is therefore important not to dissociate ourselves from what is happening in basel , even though we obviously have our own legislative procedure . 
it is , of course , crucial that we should define our own rules to enable us , as the european union , also to influence what is being decided in basel . 
having made this initial comment , i should like to point out that i believe that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach adopted towards these regulations on capital , which help deal with the issues related to risk . 
the report coincides , to a large degree , with the ideas of the commission and the objectives we are trying to achieve . 
the commission will continue to be especially vigilant in ensuring that the potentially most vulnerable sectors are taken into account . 
we ought to support these objectives by means of sound and prudent standards which guarantee the security of our markets and institutions . 
for many institutions , this approach may be neither desirable nor appropriate and , of course , its use must never be compulsory . 
right from the start , the commission has been in favour of developing a full internal ratings system , subject to standards which may be achieved by well - managed institutions , independently of their size or of the sector in which they operate . 
this is a positive development we should like to see adopted by as many institutions as possible , but we appreciate that it would not be right to insist on an internal ratings system for all financial institutions . 
with regard to amendment no 12 on the supervisory review system , i should like to point out that it is already within the powers of the supervisors to request or establish levels in excess of the minimum capital requirements . 
the proposal to use this instrument solely as a type of last resort would reduce the impact of the supervisory review process as a key element of this framework . 
i therefore think that the position needs to remain as it is . 
the debate is closed . 
i apologise to the house for being tempted at the end of the afternoon at the end of this part - session to take some of my longings for home as my inspiration for the debate on this report . 
if we think about it , as in relations with children , there comes a point in the process of the birth and growth of institutions that develop within others when we have to show , through our actions , that we acknowledge their independence . 
the time has now come to acknowledge that the institution of the ' european ombudsman ' is sufficiently grown up and has shown sufficient signs of maturity to have its own budget . 
what we are now proposing is precisely that this separation should be acknowledged , as in the council regulation of december 1999, approving the creation of a specific section for the ombudsman in the general budget of the european communities . 
the epp / ed group supports the view of the committee on constitutional affairs that the ombudsman 's competences should be enlarged and the sooner the better , especially in the fields of the ombudsman 's investigative powers laid down in article 3 of the 1994 decision . 
we are , as i have already said , the committee with responsibility for relations with the ombudsman and we work closely with him . 
the epp / ed group supports this report therefore and hopes that this , along with the bösch report on the ombudsman 's report on recruitment procedures , is a sign of the european parliament 's continued commitment to increasing transparency and accountability . 
we do not need extra work and we do not want to see examples of maladministration , but it is important that we remind european citizens that the office of ombudsman is there to help them if problems of maladministration arise . 
a lot of people unfairly criticise us for the democratic deficit . 
the ombudsman 's office certainly helps to redress that democratic deficit . 
mr president , in accordance with the nordic public service tradition , the european parliament has , positively enough , claimed that the ombudsman 's position should be strengthened and consolidated . 
the european ombudsman ought to be completely impartial when carrying out his or her duties and when he or sh. right now it is jacob söderman , a man and a good finland - swedish representativ. defends the rights of citizens in cases of bad administration . 
this is a prerequisite for giving the institution of ombudsman high credibility among citizens . 
an ombudsman is naturally bound by secrecy provisions , but it is good for citizens to know that , as ombudsman , he or she can obtain access to documents which they cannot access themselves as citizens . 
it is also important to realise that the ombudsman 's right of access to documents has nothing to do with the current regulation on openness , which is a frequent misconception . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that the report we are debating this evening fits very well into today 's agenda , because around midday today we already adopted an important report on access to documents , and i believe what we are discussing now and will have to decide tomorrow is very closely related to that . 
in relation to the ombudsman , a matter we have just been discussing , there were several complaints in the past about the lack of transparency in regard to recruitment , and that is a very crucial point , because we entirely agree with the ombudsman 's view that recruitment procedures are many young eu citizens ' first contact with the european institutions . 
here it is important for the procedures to be highly transparent , comprehensible and open . 
it is regrettable that the commission agreed to apply the ombudsman 's recommendation only for recruitment procedures launched after june 2000 . 
we believe that the institutions of the community should conduct their staff recruitment procedures , and indeed all recruitment procedures , with a maximum of openness and transparency in order to avoid the suspicion of partiality , injustice and administrative incompetence . 
parliament and the ombudsman must therefore work for the same causes . 
the report by the committee on petitions states that the committee approves the special report being discussed and , in particular , the point which states the desire to improve the impression the public gets of the institutions from our competitions procedures . 
the committee says that the commission has informed the ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of july 2000 . 
in addition , the report urges all the institutions and bodies of the european communities to allow applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers in future recruitment competitions , if they so request . 
my colleague , mr bösch , has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled . 
the fact that these competitions have been surrounded by suspicions of irregularities and favouritism in the media has been quite damaging to the public perception of the institutions . 
having good staff and officials is obviously in itself essential for well - functioning institutions and this can only be assured if the recruitment procedure is impartial and as objective as possible . 
transparency in the procedure , with due respect for the independence of the boards , is central in this regard . 
allowing the candidates to see their marked tests is a simple means of increasing transparency and confidence in the procedure for the recruitment of european civil servants . 
i call for all other institutions to follow this example . 
mr president , the members of the bonino list firmly support the bösch report and , since i do not suffer from the ideological prejudices which often characterise the behaviour of certain elements of the socialist group towards us , i would like to thank the group for the amendments which it has tabled . 
i congratulate the commission on accepting the four recommendations made in the special report on the ombudsman . 
access to official documents by citizens of the union is a hallmark of a responsible and fully functioning democracy . 
the fact that applicants for community institution jobs should see their marked scripts shows that institutions are confident in the way they run their application and selection procedures . 
it is a hallmark of a confident democracy if the processes by which selection is made is done openly and without any recourse to confidentiality or secrecy . 
and secondly , because , from a purely political point of view , its credibility depends on it . 
unlike the member states , with their long history , the european union has only a short past , which is why it must create the expectation of something new . 
and the something new in this case is that it must apply best practices and avoid anything which experience tells us will damage its credibility within the member states . 
the european union needs to give a greater impression of reliability than the member states , which have different ties with their citizens , such as ties of common descent ; the european union 's main link is the respect which the citizens of europe expect of it . 
mr president , i should first of all like to congratulate mr bösch on his report , to which the commission accords a favourable response . 
a number of the requests contained in this have already been put into effect . 
the commission endeavours to be as objective as possible , and i should like to make two comments on a couple of questions which have arisen in the debate . 
firstly , the corrections to the examinations set by the commission are always made anonymously . 
no one knows who the candidates are , since they are identified by secret codes rather than by their names . 
secondly , and where languages are concerned , the examinations take place , and are marked in , the national languages , and the tests are not converted from one language to another before they are marked . 
i should like to suggest that the bureau at some time look into the question of whether a member who limits a first supplementary to under half a minute is allowed a second question . 
that is out of place at the close of this debate but maybe you would like to write to the vice - president responsible for reforms to see if that can be incorporated in one way or another . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m . 
that is something we shall discuss presently . 
a second conflict of interests arises from the fact that , on the one hand , a fairly long transitional period is required in order to provide as many banks as possible , especially smaller institutions , with the opportunity to implement the necessary new regulations in their internal operations . 
that is why i would like to call on the council , which i believe is absent today , to carefully study the amendments we have tabled and to pay serious attention to the opinion of the european parliament . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like the previous speakers , i hope that this initiative will not be seen as the umpteenth european organisation , but that people will take this initiative seriously and , as a consequence , will give it enough of a chance . 
i just have a few reservations with regard to the name . 
the term ' police academy ' makes me think of a humorous american tv series about the police . 
social conditions in most member states of the european union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross - border cooperation between the various police forces . 
cross - border cooperation can only lead to results if a number of conditions are met , if the greatest care is taken over appropriate , goal - directed programmes for ongoing training , if attention is paid to training regarding the member states ' response to crisis situations in third countries and if exchanges and secondments are made possible in a professional way , with the emphasis on the professional aspect . 
special attention must also be paid to training at european level with regard to crime prevention , maintenance of public order and efficient border control . 
on the other hand , a european police college needs to become the forum for gaining an understanding of the various national police systems and defending the knowledge they have . 
in short , i hope that there will be no delay in giving concrete expression to this initiative which , to my mind and also in my group 's opinion , answers the need to bring about a european training structure . 
mr president , if there is one thing i have learnt about constituency problems since i was elected to the house , it is how very variable throughout europe is the interpretation of articles 5 and 6 of the european convention on human right. the right to brief detention before trial and the right to a speedy trial , the right to be released pending trial if the trial cannot proceed speedily . 
if we can get a police college for the whole of europe to do that or begin to develop this kind of common culture that would be a very good thing . 
the majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college . 
i see the need for a permanent seat for its administration but i want members of the house to think seriously about whether , in the interest of a common police culture in europe , it would be better to take everybody to one place or to have courses which move year - by - year or subject - by - subject to different police colleges and academies in different parts of the union . 
as long as such matters have not been clarified , i have to say to you in all honesty that i myself cannot consent to the basic idea . 
mr president , this is a film which we have already seen once and which we did not enjoy . 
yet another interim but not so short - term decision , another little present to parliament from the council . 
just as europol grew out of the " drugs " unit , so the seed of judicial cooperation will produce eurojust and maybe a european prosecution service . 
we can therefore safely say that a lightweight and currently practically non - existent structure such as the european police college will give rise to yet another bureaucratic structure , almost as if it were in the genetic code of the european union to entwine policies in red tape . 
it is clear , blindingly obvious and even banal to state that it is necessary to fight organised crime operating at transnational level with transnational policies , just as it goes without saying that national police forces need to be trained in order to be better equipped to tackle the cultural , legal and linguistic crime issues raised by both european integration and the integration of criminal organisations . 
nevertheless , we do not feel that this makes it necessary to create a new structure . 
the underlying reasons for establishing a police colleg. reasons which we endors. could have been better and more effectively achieved by encouraging existing national academies to develop training courses , exchanges , ma courses and specialisations to fill the gap which does , in effect , exist . 
having said this , the fact remains that mr posselt 's work is , in our opinion , excellent . 
on the other hand , we fail to understand the position of the socialist members . 
mrs karamanou has just stated that she welcomes the fact that parliament will have an advisory role , and yet , only the other day , the group of the party of european socialists voted against a motion on the grounds that the europol management board was to include members of parliament with the right to vote . 
however , mr posselt 's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence , and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the internet . 
all i can say , from a strictly british perspective , is that if this means that continental practices are to become de rigeur throughout europe , our own police force will be taking an unhealthy interest in armoured cars , water cannon , tear - gas launchers and dinky little pistols which they can swing from their already over - laden belts . 
this apart , it is something of a surprise to find that there is even such a thing as a european approach to crime fighting . 
i am absolutely certain that it will come as a rude shock to most of the british population that internal security is an area where there is any room for involvement of the european union . 
the ranks will be the same and the local badges will be untouched . 
from all the outward signs the facade will be unchanged but , under the expert tutelage of the european college , they will be working to a different agenda : a european agenda , applying community law and community measures . 
that is such a far cry from the common market which the united kingdom joined in 1973 . 
no - one in the uk would ever have believed a soothsayer from that period who warned that it would all end up in dixon of dock green whistling " ode to joy " and working out how to apply the european approach to policing down at the nick . 
but here we are in strasbourg in a near - deserted chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable . 
our own prime minister , mr tony blair , his foreign secretary , mr cook and other british ministers may deny that a superstate is on its way , but when i hear proposals for our own police forces to be trained in a european approach to crime fighting and internal security , it is obvious that the writing is on the wall . 
coming from a different part of the political spectrum , it is very interesting to hear him repeat , with the same hysteria , the same concerns . 
their capital in those days was moscow or budapest . 
those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for . 
however , i am glad to say that attitudes in the labour party in britain have changed . 
i want to thank mr posselt for his report . 
the work we do on a friday morning in parliament has the same legitimacy as the work we do on a monday or any other day . 
indeed it was commented that on wednesday evening when the commissioner spoke about bse , somebody drew attention to the fact that there were only 17 people in the house . 
there are a lot more people here this morning and i will regret the passing of friday when we can carry on a real debate and respond to each other and take the time to listen to each other . 
parliament and democracy in europe will be the poorer for the shortening of the strasbourg week . 
having said that , i welcome this proposal . 
parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy originated here , and we are grateful to the portuguese presidency for taking it up and the commission and council for their support . 
it is a good idea and in the european union where people have freedom of movement , freedom of trade and the right of establishment , where travellers from scotland can go to sicily or greece , it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law . 
that common approach is not there at the moment . 
i come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situatio. a civil war . 
but the people at that time established , very wisely , an unarmed police force that is very socially engaged with the communities in which they live and work . 
you might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order . 
when i come to continental europe i am a bit surprised at the way police distance themselves and adopt what appears to be a harder attitude . 
mr president , there are powerful criminals who think that there are no laws which apply to them and who take advantage of everyone . 
ever since border controls within the european union disappeared , they also no longer take any notice of state boundaries . 
cross - border crime requires a cross - border approach . 
because everyone agrees about that , closer cooperation between the police from the different member states and their regions has already been worked on for years . 
three days ago , following publication of the marinho , karamanou and roure reports , i pointed to the dangers attached to this . 
an enlarged and centralised police force , disconnected from its surroundings , will look for its own priorities . 
the idea of a european police college is based on the assumption that there is agreement on the tasks and modus operandi of the police . 
we see that the police in one country react totally differently to the same situation than the police in another country . 
in the netherlands , the police are trained in the de - escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities , the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena . 
i would prefer a small - scale , trained and organised police force , constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function . 
from the first discussions on this dossier , which were held at european level at the initiative of the european parliament , the commission has given a commitment to the member states to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a european police culture , grounded in the highest standards of duty , respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime . 
the commission welcomes the rapid progress made both by the portuguese presidency , which launched this initiative , and by the french presidency , which intends to adopt it by the end of the year . 
i therefore feel that the efforts made by us all will have made it possible to effectively create the european police college just one year after the decision taken by the tampere european council . 
with regard to the future of the college , the commission i. as i am sure you will be awar. of the opinion that conclusion no 47 of the tampere european council laid down , extremely clearly , that the network - style functioning of the college , which is already causing it also to be called a ' virtual ' academy , will be only the first stage . 
like the european parliament , the commission feels that it would be desirable for a formula to be adopted within a practical and clearly defined timescale , ensuring greater continuity of training action or even its development beyond the senior police officers . 
i also wish to make it clear , however , that what we are talking about here is not the creation of a european police force . 
i consider this to be an extremely important priority , not only for the candidate countries but also to ensure that the guarantees that we have to provide for our citizens that enlargement will be accompanied by safeguards for the security of member states . 
mr president , in connection with the european police college , i would point out that what is particularly important is to combat crime in the cities . 
as meps , we ourselves are very often concerned by crime . 
i hope that , in this area , the college will provide a starting point for the future . 
the establishment of the european police college is one more step towards the creation of a police state at a european level , which the ruling class believes is necessary to protect its interests from the demands of ordinary people . 
combating crime is simply a pretext . 
the establishment of the european police college is in keeping with the decision taken by the feira council to create a mobile ' expeditionary ' force of repression with police , judicial and correctional powers , which the european union will use for ' non - military crisis management ' anywhere on the planet . 
it is especially important to stress that the european police college , which is expected to start its operations on 1 january 2001, is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the member states of the european union ; it also involves the applicant countries of central and eastern europe . 
indeed , for greater effectiveness its permanent seat will be close to the border between the current european union and the applicant countries . 
for these reasons , the members of the european parliament from the communist party of greece will be voting against the report . 
. ( fr ) following on from the special council meeting in tampere , the portuguese presidency tabled an initiative in june this year with a view to adopting a council decision on establishing a european police college . 
we find the objectives of the proposal are excellent : to establish training programmes for senior officials and staff in the police forces of member states , but also applicant countries , in all crime - fighting areas necessitating cross - border cooperation . 
we also think the method adopted for this initiative is perfectly appropriate : we are not going to set up a new european structure liable to be rather divorced from reality at the national level , but rather to create a college in the form of a network made up of the existing national training institutes for senior police officers . 
each national unit would accommodate one section of the european police college . 
in this way , the college would not be based in any one place , but would be present everywhere . 
its governing board would be made up of all the directors of the national institutes , who would therefore have the benefit of full knowledge of the facts when determining their requirements . 
moreover , it would be flexible in its organisation , offering great potential for development , with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect . 
this is a good illustration of what we are starting to call ' network europe ' , a europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly , without the need to maintain pointless superstructures . 
unfortunately , this instrument , which we find perfectly satisfactory , does not seem to appeal greatly to the european parliament . 
the amendments tabled by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs are pushing in the opposite direction , emphasising that this is a temporary structure , that the time period for revision must be short , and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation . 
at this rate , there is a great danger that , in a few years ' time , we will find ourselves with a new costly superstructure that thinks itself superior to the national services , that does not cooperate well with them and ends up not being efficient enough . 
according to what i have been told , this is the route that europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course . 
in our opinion , the most effective way of working , for the european police college , as for most of the other areas of cooperation , especially in the police , justice and security sector , is to establish networks between the existing national services . 
-- ( sv ) i have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the european police college . 
in the eu , there is an obvious risk of believing , in area after area , that cooperation is advanced simply through establishing new institutions and authorities . 
i also object to the fact that the text of recital 7 in the report goes above and beyond the portuguese republic 's text in demanding one special seat for the police college instead of cooperation on a rota basis . 
that is why this regulation , which seeks to simplify the enforcement of rights of the parents with the aim of ensuring that children are able to maintain regular contact with both parents , is of major significance . 
the regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the brussels ii regulation , which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents . 
mr coelho gave some very pertinent statistics and , personally , i think it is an unacceptable anachronism that , in the europe of the twenty - first century , we legislate simply with regard to conventionally legitimate children and institutionalised human relations and that we significantly limit the scope of a regulation which is good in all other respects . 
i believe that there is a need for an immediate review of all regulations based on standards which have been overtaken by life and by contemporary reality . 
mr president , my group wishes to join in the support for this initiative and for mrs banotti 's report and indeed to join in the tributes to mrs banotti for the enormously valuable work she does as our mediator for transnationally abducted children . 
there is no doubt that split families are among the most harrowing things we hear of in our working life : mothers or fathers worried about access to children across national boundaries . 
whatever we can do to alleviate these situations , we ought to do and this regulation brought forward on a french initiative is the way forward . 
i agree with mrs karamanou and others that it is a great pity , given the way we live now , that it only covers the children of people who happen to be , or have been , married to each other . 
my mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago , and she still talks about it . 
mrs banotti has tried to make creative use of all the possibilities for securing effective arrangements for parental access on a cross - border basis too . 
she is trying to preclude all situations in which parents can misuse the existence of different rules of law in the member states of the european union in order to delay or prevent effective arrangements for parental access . 
a part of her solution involves drastically curtailing the right to call in a judge in order to overturn a foreign court order . 
that regulation will only work if both parents are nationals of an eu country or are resident within the european union and if their relationship was confirmed by a legal marriage . 
specific nature of sport 
the next item is the commission statement on the special position of sport . 
the commission feels that the treaty establishing the european community that is currently in force enables account to be taken of the specific nature of sport in general and of its social function in particular . 
it is nevertheless true that the enormous dynamic of the single market and the increasing commercialisation of sporting activities have caused a number of legal conflicts in this field . 
certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the treaty . 
other equally important sports organisations , however , such as the national olympic committees , for example , or national sports federations , have specifically insisted on the need to develop community actions for the promotion of sport . 
this is a matter of the most obvious monopoly , that of television rights , which a certain contract has ensured will continue for a hundred years . 
instead of the commission adopting a position on this , many commission members are mannequins for mr ecclestone and the motor race teams and thus contribute to establishing and upholding this monopoly . 
i wish , before the commission is granted new powers in this area , it would use those it already has . 
that concludes this item . 
uk decision to impose a levy on non - british hauliers 
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his explanation and for the fact that he came in to talk on this subject this morning . 
what he said is news to me because my understanding was that the proposal was a special tax on all foreign vehicles , which we assumed was all non - uk vehicles using the roads of the united kingdom . 
at the moment every irish citizen buys eur 5,000 of goods from britain . 
i believe that this measure is certainly contrary to free trade even with the improvement that has been mentioned by the commission . 
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement and the facts that he confirmed . 
it may be advantageous at this moment just to say what has actually been proposed by the uk government and also what they are proposing , bearing in mind the crisis in britain and indeed throughout the whole of the european union with regard to the road haulage industry . 
it must be said at the outset that this is not just a specific british problem . 
the proposal was put forward by the chancellor of the exchequer in a pre - budget statement made six months before the full budget statement made in the spring of 2001 . 
it contained a number of proposals , not just specifically this one on the vignette , which will effect the haulage industry . 
i can assure my irish colleagues that the vignette proposal is being made in full cognisance of the euro - vignette directive and is likely to be along similar lines to those already in place , as commissioner vitorino explained , in many of the present member states of the european union . 
it is worth pointing out that at the moment lorries from the united kingdom are faced with vignette or toll charges on roads in other eu member states but so far such levies have not been charged within the united kingdom . 
i am sure that the united kingdom government will be responding to the commission 's request in discussions with the commission as well as the haulage industry to explore ways in which the vignette scheme can operate within the present euro - vignette directive . 
the details of our scheme have yet to be put in place . 
in conclusion , we are being premature in the european parliament in holding this debate , but i welcome the fact and the statement from commissioner vitorino which clearly indicates that the uk government has the right to introduce a euro - vignette system provided it keeps within the rules and regulations already in place . 
i believe that is what the uk government wishes . 
mr president , with great respect i have to disagree with mr simpson . 
i do not take this debate as premature at all . 
when an important proposal of this kind comes forward we , in this house , should have the chance to think about it and discuss it as early as possible , not necessarily for the last time . 
like him , however , i was very grateful to the commissioner for the extremely clear statement of the conditions in which charges of this kind would be lawful under community law and of the real possibility that what we are facing here is not just a dodge to get out of an awkward corner , but a proposal that will fulfil community law . 
again , i thought that what mr simpson said was extremely helpful in reassuring us about the probable intentions of the uk government . 
the condition of the road leading from south west scotland into the main motorway network , the a75, is disgraceful at the moment . 
this might give us an opportunity at last to see a real and sustained improvement of the transport facilities which connect our two economies . 
later on , when one of our colleagues , mrs doyle , raised the issue , all of a sudden the president decided that this issue should go on to the agenda . 
that is not a democratic and fair way of drawing up this house 's agenda . 
this house draws up the agenda , not the president at the whim of one member . 
i also notice that mrs doyle is not here today to take part in this . 
that said , i will go on to talk about the subject in question . 
if they do bring it into effect , we want to see them really pass the benefits on to the british road - users . 
mr president , now we have vignettes dotted all over europe and tolls in some other countries , would you agree with me that the euro - vignette system is not a very good single market system . 
the local haulier in denmark or in the uk will get his full money 's worth 365 days a year , but the foreign haulier from another member state entering that countr. maybe for one or two days or ten days or even 100 day. will not . 
the best thing the british could do with this extra money is to improve our system in the hope of improving uk - irish friendship and relations . 
that concludes this item . 
adjournment of the session 
ladies and gentlemen , like all of you , i am sure , i would have liked to have been able to open this part - session without having to announce further news of the latest victims of eta terrorism . 
unfortunately , our democracies have been sent a new message of violence in the form of the particularly heinous murder of ernest lluch . 
on 22 november , the very day of the 25th anniversary of the coronation of king juan carlos , which paved the way to democracy in spain , one of the key figures in this democracy has , in turn , paid with his life for his belief in freedom , tolerance and respect for the rights of others . 
he was health minister for your country in your government , mr barón crespo . 
in the 1960s , you fought together , mr colom i naval , for democracy in spain . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
the minutes of the sitting of friday , 17 november have been distributed . 
are there any comments ? 
there are none . 
( the minutes were approved ) 
we shall deal with procedural motions after the debate on the nice summit , as you have requested . 
you are aware that we have a very full agenda and i have therefore taken this decision by virtue of the powers accorded me under the rules of procedure in order to ensure the smooth running of parliamentary business . 
you are perfectly entitled to do so pursuant to rule 18, but it must not be thought that procedural motions have nothing to do with the specific , topical issues which the members wish to raise at the beginning of a sitting , and it is important that parliament should hear them . 
let me register my protest against this decision . 
this has been noted , mr dell ' alba . 
my final comment is that i find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of " sinks " , primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure " sinks " accurately . 
we were getting closer , but sadly time ran out . 
madam president , the conference on the world climate may have broken down but substantial progress was made nonetheless . 
nuclear energy has no chance of making a comeback . 
the developing countries said : if you northern countries are going to stop using nuclear energy then we do not want it either , not even if it is subsidised . 
progress was also made in the field of enforcement . 
the developing countries are to receive usd 1 billion after 2005 . 
if the clean development mechanism starts working then they will receive between usd 5 billion and usd 25 billion in addition , annually . 
if this global warming continues , then part of the territory of the eu member states will become sea or desert . 
we will need to drastically alter our economy if we are to keep the world and europe habitable on a permanent basis . 
parliament has recently pronounced itself in favour of a number of steps that will take us in the right direction . 
the european position during the climate conference , which ende. and evidently broke dow. in the hague last saturday , was characterised by two sharply conflicting views . 
one view is that we should stick closely to the 1997 agreements in order to reduce emissions by a generous 5 % , as compared with 1990 . 
the other view is that the kyoto obligations have never been feasible because there is too much opposition from america , japan , and australia , and the only way to reach an international agreement now , would be to reduce their commitments to take action . 
creative accountancy would enable us to give the impression that they have already fulfilled a substantial number of their obligations . 
the european union made an error of judgement where the second view is concerned , because the green environment ministers of france and germany were not prepared to forget kyoto . 
we will still need to find a compromise of this kind at the follow - up conference due to take place in may 2001, in bonn . 
my group favours the first view . 
it is important for europe to stick with a position taken up previously , even though it means that the united states will not be in a position to subscribe to an agreement of this kind for the period of the bush administration . 
taking the long - term view , it is important that we convince the american public of the dangers of the do - nothing option , rather than agreeing a compromise with our opponents . 
the united states produce the largest amount of pollution per capita . 
as yet , american public opinion has not given a great deal of credence to the notion that the deserts will expand and there will be an increase in hurricanes . 
that is why we need to keep these realities in mind in the follow - up to the climate conference . 
a compromise cannot mean forgetting what was agreed in kyoto . 
i compliment commissioner wallström on her efforts in the hague and wish her more success . 
madam president , we too were very disappointed that the conference on climate change in the hague broke down . 
any discussion as to where the blame lies leads all too easily to the united states being singled out for criticism . 
as i see it , the fact that no agreement was reached was ultimately down to the intransigence of the european union . 
the discussion in the hague focused mainly on the question as to what exactly can be taken into account as regards the reductions agreed in kyoto . 
in october we were able , during the discussion of the proposal concerning trade in emissions , to opt for efficient and effective ways of reducing emissions . 
unfortunately , parliament failed to make a clear choice at the time . 
as far as the 50 % is concerned , i feel i must point out that this objective should never be the be all and end all . 
if we could reach an agreement with the united states which allows them to work towards a lower realisation percentage in their own country , this would always be preferable to having no agreement at all . 
the same applies to the partial inclusion of the co2 sinks , such as the additional planting of forests . 
although i do not have a good word to say about the us stance , one thing i do know is that the united states were prepared to achieve an acceptable compromise at the end of the conference . 
without doubt , it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that , in this instance , the american proposal was a third - rate proposal , and one which was completely unacceptable to europe . 
in any case , an agreement can only be accepted and acceptable if there is a balance between north and south , between developing countries and industrialised countries . 
i am already extremely concerned about resorting to the right to pollute . in my opinion , this can only hinder the economic development of countries that are already extremely underdeveloped . 
the united states ' position , resorting to the idea of forests being carbon sinks , is unacceptable , for , then , no one would make any effort . 
we must reject these american diktats . 
this situation highlights the limitation of a europe which , with its rotation of presidencies , does not have a strong political image to present to the united states and does not speak with a single voice . 
it also clearly highlights , once again , the desperate need to reform the european institutions and the way they operate . 
when will we have a president of the european union that is strong and capable alone of representing europe with regard to our partners ? 
let us conclude , however , on a hopeful note . 
the conference in the hague is to be resumed , as you have informed us , commissioner , next spring in bonn . 
you may count on our support , commissioner , so we might be able to stand up to the united states and take up the gauntlet . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let us not beat about the bush , the climate conference in the hague was a flop , which is disappointing because it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change is happening much faster than anticipated . 
therefore the world needs a powerful political signal . 
kyoto must not remain an empty promise . 
the debate is closed . 
preparation of nice european council and trade policy 
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on the preparation of the nice european council from 7 to 9 december 2000, including trade policy . 
so today i will just be bringing you up to date on the main issues under discussion . 
real progress on qualified majority and enhanced cooperation was made at the informal european council of biarritz . 
there was also a beneficial clarification of the issues around the commission and the weighting of votes , allowing each member state to get a better idea of the objectives and difficulties of the others . 
pierre moscovici reported to you on that on 24 october . 
we have been building on that foundation over the last few weeks taking all the points of view into account with a view to arriving at a compromise , but keeping our sights set on an ambitious agreement at nice . 
we sometimes hear the presidency accused of lacking ambition ; there are no grounds for saying that today . 
that is clearly demonstrated by the texts submitted to the igc , despite the extreme difficulty of the subject matter , and i really do sense a genuine determination to succeed on the part of the fifteen . 
good progress has been made on qualified majority voting , which could be extended to another thirty areas , if some member states make the effort to confirm this . 
this at least provides a serious avenue to be explored in nice , one that still remains to be defined and clarified but on which a clear majority of the delegations is ready to work . 
let me add that we have not yet reached agreement on the distribution of seats in the european parliament . 
your own proposal has obviously been submitted by the presidency and is one of the two options on the table . 
there too , a solution will have to be found at nice . 
on the other hand , the idea of a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in article 6, championed by the european parliament in its recommendation of 14 november , and placed on the table at the igc by the french presidency , was vigorously rejected by several member states . 
it may be regrettable , but i have to recognise the position . 
finally , a word on the court of justice . 
the work is almost complete . 
on the other hand , even though the presidency has also proposed extending to parliament the right of appeal to the court under article 230, several delegations are against that at this stage . 
i want to be as objective as possible about the situation before this very important council . 
in nice , as you know , our aim is to achieve a good agreement , which naturally means compromise , but compromise that is constructive , not regressive . 
at nice , the heads of state and government and the ministers will devote all the time that is necessary to that discussion . 
they have even arranged for the council to continue through sunday if that is absolutely essential . 
finding an agreement which will enable the union to operate after the new accessions currently in active preparation is vital for the future of the european union and indeed the enlarged union . 
the nice european council will also be tackling other major issues on which the french presidency has worked with a great deal of determination . 
first , the charter of fundamental rights . 
the conditions are now in place for the proclamation of this charter by the three institutions at nice . 
we will therefore have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the cologne european council and the european union will have at its disposal a very strong benchmark , clearly setting out the rights and values in which it believes . 
the discussion on a possible legal status for this charter will be pursued after nice and could form part of a broader , longer term debate on the future of the european union . 
the european council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement . 
you yourselves debated this on 3 october . 
our objective was to prepare an overview of the process and decide how to take it forward from this point . 
at the general affairs council of 20 november we had a very good debate based on the excellent documents the commission had forwarded to the council . 
i think the stepping up of the negotiations has been widely welcomed and at the next general affairs council , and then at the european council , we will be able to adopt a clear and ambitious line for the continuation of the discussions on the basis of the principles set in helsinki , which should lead directly to the desired outcome . 
at nice , the european council will be preceded by a summit meeting of the european conference . 
the lisbon european council approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive european economy . 
the aim was , in particular , to enrich the broad economic policy guidelines and ensure better coordination with the employment guidelines . 
so a report will be passed to the european council which will finalise the definition of performance indicators in spheres such as employment , innovation , economic reform and social cohesion . 
similarly , employment guidelines are to be forwarded to the european council together with an autumn 2000 employment package . 
as you know , last monday the ecofin council reached a decisive agreement on fiscal harmonisation . 
these matters had been under discussion for several months , not to say several years , arousing strong reservations on the part of some member states . 
so this is a very important step forward by the whole fifteen , and the european council will certainly take formal note of it . 
one was that those candidate states themselves must adopt and implement the ' acquis communautaire ' ; that is their task shared with us . 
the second lock on the door is that we ourselves , as fifteen , needed to recognise the fundamental need to reform how we do business in order to continue to do business effectively , indeed to begin to do business even more effectively than at present . 
that is the unavoidable and minimum requirement of nice and it is a major and central target . 
we in this parliament will be required at the end of that process to give or not to give our assent . 
it is a major responsibility . 
i speak for a group which is totally committed to the earliest feasible enlargement of the european union . 
i also say that we will listen with great care to what mr prodi and the commission say by way of analysis of the nice treaty and to the candour which he promises . 
we ourselves will go through a very candid analysis . 
my appeal to you , mr president - in - office , is to present us in this parliament a document worthy of this parliament 's assent and a document worthy of the scale of the historic challenge we face in europe . 
that challenge is the reunification of our old continent ; that challenge is an enlargement unparalleled in scale and that is what nice must prepare us for . 
to do less than that is to fail europe and this house , when it reviews nice , cannot allow europe to fail . 
i should like to say , with regard to a number of the specific points , that my group believes that , at this stage of evolution of the european union , having one national for each member state of the commission still remains a sensible proposition and enhances the legitimacy of the union . 
it should not become an issue which traduces the union into a false contest between the interests of the large and the small , when the common european interest should be the central goal . 
my group , at this stage , would prefer a reweighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that other issues are under review . 
we support enhanced cooperation but insist that it must be open - ended and open to all and not exclusive and must be based and rooted in a way which respects the ' acquis communautaire ' . 
we are deeply attached to the charter of fundamental rights and we do not want simply to declaim the charter . 
if we proclaim it as something with meaning , it must find roots , and we still commend to you to root it in article 6 . 
we commend to you to give the proclamation a meaning in substance , even if it is not yet fully and completely in such a case judiciable . 
we support the review of article 7 because the austrian lesson has taught the need of it . 
nice is a test to see if our old continent is ready for a new , continental - scale enlargement . 
i believe that we can succeed but , mr president - in - office , we need your presidency to mobilise the council for europe by animating the nice council to achieve something which is genuinely historic . 
there should not merely be constructive compromise , those were your words , there must be significant achievement . 
we will set the bar high and i hope together , council , commission and parliament , we can clear that bar . 
i say this today , if the bar is compromised and is too low , we will refuse to consider it and we will do so for europe and we will do it in good conscience . 
i might also add , on behalf of my group , that we are fully committed to enlargement taking place as soon as possible . 
however , it is important at this stage to discuss what is to happen post - nice . 
i would appeal to mr barón crespo for understanding in this matter , as i have a feeling that the other group chairmen do support this aim to leave the matter of the size of the european parliament to some extent open . 
this would be a very important position for parliament to adopt , and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow . 
madam president , mr president of the council , mr president of the commission , i do not believe that the governments of the 15 member states have covered themselves in glory . 
if democracy is to be strengthened , this naturally implies that majority voting must be accompanied by a right of codecision for the european parliament . 
but success in nice also means that there must be more than mere proclamation of the charter of fundamental rights . 
i find it quite intolerable that several governments have simply brushed aside the question of including a reference to the charter in article 6 of the treaty . 
you do not even intend to incorporate it into the treaty , evidence indeed that this text , this exercise was always destined to be laid aside . 
we are also concerned by the future of the commission , the driving force of european integration which , when expanded to 20, 25 or 30 members , will clearly be reduced to an administrative secretariat , a technical secretariat of the council , a body unable to play even the tiniest role in the institutional balance intended by the founding fathers . 
over qualified majority voting and weighting , there will , in all probability , be vetos from all sides which will paralyse the demands of parliament and the public for a move towards democratisation of our system , towards making majority voting the general rule . 
i therefore appeal to president prodi , who has rightly promised that he will tell us in strasbourg whether or not the commission will be able act effectively , whether or not the union will be able to act effectively after the nice summit . 
president prodi , you are going to take part in the nice summit , you will in a way be the expression of the will of parliament , albeit a timidly expressed will , the will which tomorrow will become clear when we vote on the document which has resulted from the compromise between groups and which we have not signed . 
mr prodi , present your objections to the summit , assume the responsibility , not of establishing a role for us as the post - nice panel of judges , but of playing right to the very last the card of defending first and foremost the european institutions , the commission and parliament in particular . 
mr president , the draft nice treaty is more like a constitution for a federal state than an agreement for an association of states . 
there are still 65 categories of legislation requiring unanimity according to the treaty of amsterdam . 
it is now proposed that decisions should be made by qualified majority voting in 49 of these areas . 
we are therefore approaching the point of no return , beyond which a unitary state is unavoidable . 
the powers to be given to the eu by the treaty of nice treaty go beyond those exercised at federal level in many federal states . 
home affairs and legal policy are to be subject to majority voting as from 2004 . 
trade policy will make the eu countries resemble a state . 
in democracies , it is the other way around . 
majority decision - making will destroy the right of veto for the member states as parliamentary democracies , but the eu will not itself become a parliamentary democracy . 
with enhanced cooperation , the right of veto over treaty changes is also destroye. not formally , but in practic. because a qualified majority will in future be able to ignore resistance from , for example , denmark , sweden and great britain or other places in which the undemocratic idea might arise of asking the electorate what it thinks . 
the federalists can achieve their desire for more integration , and the governments in sweden , great britain and denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions , binding in practice , have been taken . 
nice will transfer so much power from the electorate that it ought to be treated as a genuine constitutional change and only come into force once it has been approved in referendums in those countries in which referendums are possible . 
mr president , the very title of this item on our agenda indicates the importance of article 133 in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting . 
while its extension to trade in services is an understandable aim , it has little to do with the main issue of institutional reform , which needs to be resolved as a matter of priority ; the demand contained in point 7 of the joint resolution regarding the extension of external negotiating competence in the field of trade to cover investment has even less to do with this main issue . 
in view of the rather dim prospects of success , i do not think it would be a wise move to burden the intergovernmental conference with another complex and controversial topic . 
given the current state of negotiations , it is doubtful whether even an extension of the conference to the sunday , along with the customary extra hour that is gained when the clocks go back , would be sufficient to ensure that this question , along with all the others , will be properly resolved . 
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , mr prodi , what matters most as far as the ppe - de group is concerned , is for the igc to reach a successful conclusion . 
it is therefore no way to tackle the fact that the decision - making process within the european union is still akin to wading through treacle . 
mr president , europe needs leadership , clarity , choices and decisiveness . 
that is what the people actually want to see . 
in view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro , people need to see that we are taking steps forward . 
so i feel it is the weighty task of the french presidency to at last whip up some enthusiasm for nice . 
it is extremely sad that a situation has developed where large and small countries have come to take opposite sides . 
the igc still seems to be experiencing problems with the extension of qualified voting within the council . 
perhaps we should shift the focus to the issue of extending codecision with the parliament . 
parliament has proved itself a mature partner with the council in the codecision procedure where it presently pertains . 
parliament has also proved itself a serious partner within the drafting of the charter , and it would be especially refreshing should british prime minister blair publicly recognise that fact . 
at present the spread of codecision is neither logical nor does it accord with precise criteria . 
although the previous treaty made some progress in extending the formula , it also brought in the crazy formula of codecision plus unanimity for citizenship , social security , the rights of the self - employed and also cultural policy . 
the treaty of nice should stop that practice and extend codecision to some thirty further policy sectors , including competition policy , farm and fisheries , structural funds , state aids , trans - european networks , research and development and also citizenship . 
at a time when crude balance of power questions are proving fairly problematical for the igc , surely it is sensible for it to focus on building up cooperation and trust with the parliament and developing post - national european democracy as fast as possible . 
mr prodi , i am extremely concerned at what might be the outcome of the final night of the negotiations , that night when the victors are usually those with the greatest resistance to tiredness and boredom , that night which everyone sees as the last chance to resolve the points which are still without solutions . 
this is the most negative , most undemocratic part of the intergovernmental method : the whims of the human element , the results of last - minute bargaining and the obligation to achieve a result at all costs . 
. i think that it is timely , on the eve of the nice summit , to question the current state of this spirit of " de facto solidarity " , without which , european integration can be clearly neither genuine nor authentic . 
with regard to the conclusion of the igc , what must take place in nice is that an agreement must be reached which whilst correcting the deficit in the functioning of the european institutions , does not affect the existing balance between member states and , of course , between these states and the union . 
the very fact that this issue is being debated now is in itself a clear sign of the failure of a policy to strengthen ties of mutual trust between the countries that comprise the union . 
we are not the only ones to say this ; the french presidency has also said as much through its minister , mr moscovici , who acknowledged in a recent interview that the positions that have been adopted during the course of this year , particularly by president chirac and by the german minister for foreign affairs , joschka fischer , on the future organisation of the union have had the direct effect of heightening a climate of mistrust between small and large member states , which will inevitably be reflected in the results of the nice european council . 
forty areas can be listed in which voting by qualified majority is to be introduced , areas such as the appointment of members to the committee of the regions . 
i would gladly give up these 40 extensions if we could achieve majority voting in five areas where substantive progress can be made , such as trade , social policy , justice and home affairs , structural policy and taxation , to name the most important . 
our appeal to the heads of state and government is that each of them should put his playthings into the communal toy box , so that the others will do likewise , rather than each waiting for the others to make the first move and then nothing happening at all . 
this , quite simply , is the situation in which we have been stuck for months at the intergovernmental conference , because none of them are willing to give up their toys . 
i hope that , at the start of the ministerial meeting of the intergovernmental conference , someone will have the backbone to give up his toys in order to pressurise the others into making a move . 
secondly , the democratic deficit must not start to widen again . 
in amsterdam , it was decided that qualified - majority voting should always be accompanied by codecision . 
any derogation from this rule will fuel the democratic deficit and undermine the progress made in amsterdam . 
mr president , even paris is divided over nice . 
the french president and the first minister seem to be more obsessed with their own political future than with that of europe . 
the french presidency has shown little enough consistency , and where it has this has mainly been in terms of its lack of neutrality and the preferential treatment it has given to the large member states , and that at a time when the union has never been more in need of a president who looks for consensus . 
in order to make room for the newcomers , all member states need to move a little closer together , but they only do so when they really cannot put off the evil moment any longer . 
it seems as if some governments are already reconciling themselves to a new igc for enlargement . 
the governments have lost sight of the urgent need for reforms because they are concentrating too much on their own position of power in the new set - up . 
for example , many a country will emphasise that majority decision making must become the general rule , but at the same , will come up with so many exceptions that precious little remains on balance . 
if majority voting does not become the general rule then decision - making will become irretrievably deadlocked , as mr prodi rightly commented a moment ago . 
if this does not go hand - in - hand with codecision then democracy will be further undermined . 
the weighting of votes in the council must do justice to the population numbers in the member states , which means that it is quite acceptable for there to be some corresponding differences between the larger and smaller countries . 
all member states must retain one commissioner of their own during this enlargement round . 
only afterwards should we decide on a new system on the basis of the experience we will have gained by then . 
if one thing is for certain , europe is going to undergo radical change , and so let us not run ahead of a situation that we are unable to take stock of as yet . 
it would be very desirable to introduce a hierarchy into the commission , i.e. vice - presidents , commissioners and under - commissioners . 
in addition , this would afford parliament more opportunities to discuss issues with politically responsible members of the commission rather than officials who read out actual texts that they could just as easily have sent . 
the charter does not deserve to be left in a vacuum , with no clear status . 
in failing to incorporate the text into the treaty and only subscribing to it in political terms , we are opening the door to major problems of legal interpretation . 
hence the charter must be incorporated into a treaty text as soon as possible . 
i have this to say to the heads of governments : making concessions at the forthcoming summit is not a political defeat but a political triumph : the triumph of the new europe over the old . 
do not allow any shadows to fall over nice , and let paris be the city of light again . 
mr president i would like to remind the council and commission , and indeed the house , of a resolution that we carried on 26 october in relation to better law - making . 
we there said that " in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and the political and national diversity of the european union , the amendments made to the treaties should specifically include recognition of , and respect for , the political and legislative powers of the members states ' internal political units in their executive , legislative and judicial relations with the european union institutions " . 
that aspect of subsidiarity has not been heard in our debate today but it is very important . 
it bears also in a most important way on the question of the size of this parliament . 
the nations and regions which the parties of the european free alliance represent are deeply concerned that if we apply together the maximum of 700 and the current idea of digressive proportionality , the people whom we are able to represent here at the present time will effectively cease to be represented in this house . 
that will be a huge loss to european democracy and it will take the institutions further from the people not closer to them . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for a youngster like me , nice certainly represents a great hope for a new europe , in political as well as institutional terms . 
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , mr president of the commission , as soon as nice has finished , it will the european parliament 's turn to reply to two historic questions , questions which affect both the future of the european union and its own political credibility . 
let us not compound the disappointment which nice will cause if it is unsuccessful by giving the people huge cause for disappointment in parliament . 
nice , if it is unsuccessful , can make amends , but if parliament proves to be unreliable , it will take years to wipe the slate clean . 
a european union without a credible parliament is a transient and a poor state of affairs . 
this sector is currently one of the most centralised and untransparent . 
that was one of the main criticisms of the protestors at seattle and it will continue to be one of their criticisms at nice . 
that means it is not only a question of the parliament having a much greater role in decision - making on trade . 
that is , of course , important and i am surprised that others have not mentioned it as it has occupied much of our time in the committee . 
but it also means restructuring the committee 133 itself : making it far more accountable ; ensuring that its agenda and conclusions are accessible and that its composition is broad and inclusive . 
mr president , i am speaking not just to the president - in - office of the council but also to all the governments of the member states when i say that if agreement is not reached in nice on these difficult issues those issues will not go away . 
every government is saying we need more qualified majority voting , but they all have their list of exceptions . 
the problem is if you put the lists of exceptions next to each other you will find there are very few areas of substance where it is agreed to switch to qualified majority voting . 
everyone will have to sacrifice some of their cherished exceptions if we are to reach a result in nice . 
of course some governments will be attacked in their member states by opposition parties , by euro - sceptics , saying , " you are giving up the national right of veto " . 
but it has to be understood that if you have the right of veto then so does everyone else . 
so in a union of 27 member states for every veto you trade in , 26 other vetoes are being given up at the same time . 
consequently , things that you want will no longer be vetoed by others . 
everyone can gain from a system of qualified majority voting . 
if we are to have more qualified majority voting on legislation it must go hand in hand with codecision , not only for the new areas which will come to qualified majority voting but also for the existing areas that already come under qualified majority voting . 
this is essential for democracy at union level . 
to adopt european legislation you must pass two tests : acceptability to the elected governments meeting in the council , and acceptability to the directly - elected meps in the european parliament . 
these are two safeguards for the quality and the acceptability of european legislation . 
it is nothing to be afraid of . 
the working of the codecision procedure over the last year shows that it works . 
in more than three quarters of the cases we do not even need the conciliation committee ; the two readings each in council and parliament are enough to reach agreement . 
if this is working here let us make it work across the whole spectrum of legislation . 
finally , there is the question of the number of seats in the european parliament . 
we know that a definitive solution must be in place for the parliament to be elected in 2009, which will , after all , last until 2014 . 
as far as voting in the council is concerned , i think that the double majority is the best system because it is more representative and more objective . 
as far as extending qualified majority voting is concerned , we are agreed that , unless we make some sort of move in this direction , we shall encounter a great many problems . 
so i think that , as a first move , it should already be agreed that trade policy needs to come under qualified majority voting . 
as far as foreign policy is concerned , we now live in mr solana 's bright and beautiful world and let me tell yo. if we leave the common foreign policy solely within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation , then we shall be making a big mistake . 
the common foreign policy needs to be fully integrated into community procedure because only then shall we have the necessary safety valves . 
finally , mr president - in - office of the council , i must , of course , mention the charter , which affects millions of european citizens . 
i take the view that nice must at least accept the compromise called for by the european parliament , i.e. for the charter to be combined with article 6, paragraph 2 . 
i do not believe that failure is an option . 
we have been talking about amsterdam leftovers . 
our public in the eu and the public in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of nice leftovers , of a second igc in 2004 . 
i hope that we are in a position to congratulate the french presidency for its success ; but if you fail , we shall be harsh in our condemnation . 
mr president , on the face of it , the nice summit is all about making the necessary adaptations and dealing with the leftovers in the light of enlargement . 
but there is far more than that at stake . 
the nice summit will not just address the issue as to whether the member states are prepared to give up their commissioner , it will mainly be concerned with their willingness to give shape to the type of european political cooperation that promotes the interests of the european citizen , transcending national interests . 
it has frequently come to our notice of late that this political cooperation is totally absent . 
a brilliant example is , of course , the nationally motivated measures , and the reaction to the unrest over the high diesel and petrol prices ; where concerted action could have given a huge boost to the credibility of european political cooperation in the eyes of the citizens . 
they have nothing to offer . 
what they offer is a balkans type scenario , which is the worst thing imaginable . 
the balkans is the sceptics ' ideal . 
to hear mr bonde talk , the balkans is his ultimate ideal . 
we can expect no better of him . 
if we then see that these people have absolutely no alternative , would only bring us misery and would bring our industry into a much worse state than it is at present , then far too much notice is being taken of them . 
i feel it is also up to the council to try to act not just for the sake of national interests but also for the sake of the common european interest , because united we stand , divided we fall , and we had better not forget it . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , greater power for the european union to act in the field of foreign trade and payments is one of the fundamental demands of the european parliament and of the commission too , as you , president prodi , emphatically underlined earlier today . 
although we now see the french presidency , mr president of the council , playing a decisive part here , it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today , just a few days before the igc ministerial meeting . 
you bear responsibility for the success of this project ; you , the president - in - office of the council , also have the power to make things happen . 
we should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services , as well as investments , intellectual property and competition , in the range of matters which are subject to qualified - majority voting in the council of ministers and amend article 133 ( 1 ) of the treaty accordingly . 
that is our basic demand . 
now , very few days before the ministerial meeting of the present intergovernmental conference , the signs are once again unpromising . 
this time , however , it is paradoxically the prospect of an emerging consensus that is causing us political headaches . 
as the days go by , it is becoming ever likelier that the agreement the ministers will reach , while not representing the lowest common denominator , will be a rather low common denominator , indeed a very low common denominator . 
we cannot do this without the involvement and firm support of the peoples , who must see the european institution as the defender of their rights and the guarantor of their future , not as the seat of the bureaucracy and petty feuds of a limited , primitive political system . 
let us all endeavour to ensure that nice is not the end of the line but the launching pad for a major project . 
in short , we must all aim high , and , in order to do this , we must believe implicitly in what we are doing . 
mr president , we members of forza italia and the european people 's party believe in this project and we will be protagonists alongside you in the construction of a europe of the citizens . 
mr president , i wish firstly to thank the members of the european parliament for a very high standard of debate . 
i think it was first mentioned in 1989 actually . 
so that picture is inaccurate , and i think the sensible thing is to put it behind us . 
that is exactly what we did as regards the commission . 
i would simply appeal to you not to make a premature scapegoat of the presidency - in - office . there is no justification for that when the council has not even taken place yet , and disappointment itself is premature because it is too early to come to any conclusions . 
i understand all about the waiting , the impatience , the hopes and ambitions . 
i understand all that , i am listening , i am taking account of it and i will try to ensure that we bear it in mind and apply it to the political decisions we face in the course of the difficult negotiations in nice . 
thank you very much mr president of the commission . 
to conclude these statements , i have received nine motions for resolutions from eight groups , in accordance with rule 37, paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure. . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow . 
as the president , mrs fontaine , announced at the beginning of the sitting , we will now proceed to the debate on the procedural motions . 
i wish to refer to the disgraceful demonstration that took place in the foreign affairs committee of this parliament yesterday morning when the turkish minister of foreign affairs was involved in discussions with us . 
a number of members of a marxist - leninist group tried to disrupt the meeting and threatened the chairman . 
this was an abuse of this parliament 's proceedings , a gross discourtesy to a distinguished guest and an event that could have had very serious consequences . 
mr president , will you please instruct the quaestors to identify the culprits , to identify how they obtained access to the parliament and ensure that they are banned from future access . 
will you also take steps generally to tighten security in appropriate ways so that there could be no recurrence . 
it is sometimes difficult to get legitimate visitors and groups into this building but those with malign intentions seem to have no difficulty . 
we began this session by expressing our condolences for the latest victim of terrorism in spain . 
it would seem that those responsible for the demonstration in the foreign affairs committee may have connections with a turkish terrorist group . 
i am sure that all in this house will join me in condemning all terrorism whatever its alleged motivation . 
in relation to turkey , we are making many demands of the turkish government and people as they embark on the long road to accession to the european union . 
at the same time , we expect that opposition groups in turkey will resort exclusively to peaceful means . 
i shall be placing a declaration to this effect before the house and i trust all members will give it their support . 
i believe that we must take action , which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto , in order to ensure that the guests of parliament can feel like guests in this house and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour . 
to that end , we must put the requisite organisational and security structure in place , which also means our guests being directly protected by people who are trained for that purpose , because we naturally cannot employ foreign security staff to escort our guests . 
i believe we face a new challenge here , to which i ask the bureau to respond . 
the turkish police force immediately prevented her from speaking not just in kurdish , which in any case she had ceased to do , but even in german , and there had to be negotiations before she was able to pass on a message of greetings from my group in german . 
virtually the same day , a leader from the cypriot parliament , who has , moreover , already visited the european parliament , mr christou , was refused a turkish visa even though he was travelling , if you can believe it , to a tripartite meeting in istanbul between turks , greeks and cypriots , in a totally peaceable context . 
i therefore urge you , mr president , to please ask mrs fontaine , as president of parliament , to send a letter to the turkish authorities , certainly in order to apologise for this shabby treatment of one of their representatives but also to remind them that members of the european parliament or indeed members of the candidate countries travelling to their country should not be treated in this way . 
hospitality over here and hospitality and respect over there . 
i would like to associate my group with this complaint about this very serious and indeed frightening incident . 
i would say to mr wurtz that it is a part of the process of trying to open up the prospect of european integration for turkey that we show them the sanctity and power of parliamentary democracy . 
if we cherish it inside this place , we should certainly be prepared to welcome and secure our guests in a very much more credible fashion than we showed ourselves able to do yesterday . 
if we are not proud of our parliament , we cannot expect the turks to copy us . 
mr president , i should like to draw both your and the house 's attention to the incident which mr wurtz referred to , i.e. the fact that the turkish government refused a visa to the cypriot member of parliament and parliamentary representative of akel , andreas christou , who was due to attend a meeting of turkish , greek and cypriot parties in istanbul . 
andreas christou , i may add , is the deputy chairman of the cypriot parliament 's delegation to the eu - cyprus joint parliamentary committee . 
i would like , on behalf of the communist party of greece , to express our outrage and horror at the latest act of provocation on the part of turkey , a candidate country for membership of the european union , and to join in the call for a protest to be made in the name of the european parliament . 
these workers have come to parliament to present a petition bearing over 10 000 signatures , calling precisely for the support of the european institutions . 
this is because they have been made redundant by their company despite the fact that it is economically sound and that it has been expanding for some years . 
telecom italia is therefore a company which raises its prices and cuts jobs . 
in recent weeks , in recent days , we have been discussing the charter of fundamental rights and the rights of workers . 
it would therefore be appropriate for parliament to endeavour to avoid there being such a huge discrepancy between its fine declarations of principles and harsh reality . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
at the beginning of today 's sitting , madame president paid homage to the memory of ernest lluch . 
in 1966, ernest lluch , his brother and myself , with more than 60 other members of the teaching staff were expelled by the francoist regime from the university of barcelona . 
from that time on , in spite of our different political opinions , i recognised the sincere commitment of ernest lluch in the struggle for dialogue and understanding , even facing the authoritarian position of the present government . 
the best homage to ernest lluch and to his memory would be to respect his messag. dìaleg in catala. can we all give this a chance in the basque country ? 
thank you very much , mr gorostiaga . 
would you please sit down and remove that sign . 
in this letter , mrs hautala made mention of our support and sympathy for the efforts undertaken by the president , mrs fontaine , to set up negotiations on our own statute as meps . 
it is therefore a matter of the deepest regret to us that a meeting that was planned for 30 november was cancelled . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as i speak to you today , i am aware of taking part in a key turning point in the life of europe , because this is , i think , the first time that a minister of defence has addressed your parliament . 
on 24 october , i reviewed the progress of a european defence system with your committee on foreign affairs , human rights and common security and defence policy . 
i am delighted to continue in this vein by talking to you today about the results of our conference on military commitments of 20 november . 
i wish , first of all , to express my agreement with the wording of your resolution of 21 november on the european security and defence policy . 
you claim that this policy does not aim to compete with the north atlantic alliance , which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its members , or to establish a permanent european army . 
the presidency and , i believe , all our governments share this view . 
firstly , we have the catalogue of capabilities , a 300 - page document which scrupulously lists all the military capabilities that are known to be needed by our union in order to guarantee that all of the petersberg tasks can be fulfilled . 
i would remind you of the wide range of tasks that this covers : humanitarian aid , the evacuation of nationals , conflict prevention and also the separation by force of the warring parties . 
by 2003, when the bodies that have been established are in a position to fulfil their duties , the european union will gradually become capable of accomplishing some of the petersberg tasks . 
these are a few remarks , which have had , out of necessity , to be concise and as a result , incomplete in order to adhere to the rules of your parliament , on the assessment that can be made today of the real achievements in the field of military capabilities , which have already been adopted or are about to be adopted , by the nice european council . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to take a few words to describe the profound political significance , which has been approved by the majority of public opinion in our countries , of this new task that will provide europe with a tool for political influence that it has , until now , lacked . 
it is a matter of the very survival of the people there . 
on behalf of the entire pse group , i would like to express my admiration for the outstanding report by catherine lalumière , our highly esteemed fellow member . 
my group supports her position and we are grateful for the well - balanced text , which brings out the right points . 
as you will all be aware , there is to be a new approach to the common foreign and security policy ; in which the civilian component will be deemed to be at least as important as the military component . 
the rapid reaction force is intended to implement the petersberg tasks . 
however , we must not exaggerate the importance of this . 
although i do not agree with the cynics who say that it will provide europe with a pointless toy , it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately deployable in many situations . 
we regard it as an instrument that can be deployed alongside others , or better still , as one that can be deployed after other instruments , where possible . 
it therefore seems a little unnecessary to regulate in great detail how , for example , european forces in space are to be organised . 
the eu ought not to develop its own defence involving permanent troops . 
as i say , things are developing quickly . 
in the course of the week , country after country has reported on how many soldiers , aircraft , submarines etc it can contribute to make the rapid reaction force operational . 
judging from the debate in a number of member states , many people are clearly rather bewildered by the debate . 
commissioner patten gave a first - hand account of the debate in great britain . 
in another country close to my heart , the debate has been quite heated . 
in sweden , a somewhat sluggish debate about neutrality is taking place , a concept which most of us perceive as a hangover from the days of the cold war and as not being relevant today . 
i am therefore hoping for broad support for the liberal amendments which deal specifically with the issues of transparency and public access to documentation . 
mr president , mr richard , commissioner , i would like to restrict my contribution to two important sections of the report by mrs lalumière . 
the first section i am referring to is the one on conflict prevention and crisis management . 
i think the stability pact for the balkans is a good example of this . 
as i see it , it sets an example of how things should be done in the european union , and it demonstrates that by taking various measures , for example in the field of democracy , support for the free press , and in the field of education , conflict prevention policy can help us to keep the lid on the situation . 
the second section i would like to come back to is the military section . 
the first point concerns the role of the european parliament , which is something several other speakers have already touched on . 
it is still completely unclear in the current proposals as to what that role should be . 
the first thing they expect is for us to call for international observers to be sent out to protect the people concerned . 
thirdly , we should call for new peace negotiations to begin , based on the same principles that we uphold in all the other parts of the world , namely the requirement of respect for international law and the geneva conventions , the requirement of respect for the united nations resolutions . 
in this case , that means an end to the occupation , including that of east jerusalem , the dismantling of the settlements and recognition of the refugee problem . 
it is the constant violation of these fundamental rights , despite seven years of negotiations , and the resulting exasperation that lie at the core of this popular revolt . 
so it is these problems that we must resolve if we are to see a return to peace , to a lasting peace . 
for the rest , many israelis agree and opinions polls show that over and above any voting intentions , an absolute majority of them accept the idea of a global peace agreement with the palestinians , including the dismantling of the settlements . 
mr president , minister , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have two very important reports to deal with today and an important question relating to the dreadful intolerable situation in afghanistan . 
nevertheless , i should like to concentrate on the lalumière report , because it documents the progress that has undoubtedly been achieved in the domain of european defence and security policy and sets that progress in a balanced and democratic framework . 
it is balanced , because the report makes it quite clear that we need three things : the first is an analysis of the various risk factors in and around europe , the second is prevention , and the third is civilian crisis management . 
only if all of that is to no avail do we need military crisis management . 
it will not always be possible to take these steps one after the other in chronological order , but we need the entire package , and the fact is that only all of these factors together will make a coherent , balanced defence and security policy in europe . 
the report , however , also brings a democratic framework into play , and i should like to lay particular emphasis on that here . 
minister , i should like to say a special word of thanks to you for having been with us in committee and for being here today . 
however , your personal commitment must not be seen as a substitute for democratic legitimisation of the european security and defence policy . 
defence policy , the question of defence spending , is a national matter and must be determined and overseen by the national parliaments . 
there is , however , a european level of security policy , and the european parliament acts as a budgetary authority for security expenditure at that level . 
we need cooperation between the national and european levels , and we also need democratic supervision . 
i realise , minister , that you are sceptical and that you have just said ' no ' again , as you did in paris on a previous occasion , but this parliament still believes in these principles , irrespective of party allegiance , and we shall go on campaigning for their acceptance . 
the finnish people have not been told anything about this . 
i cannot approve of the eu becoming a military alliance and a military superpower . 
the nato countries could form a defence organisation within the framework of the union that would function as a strong european pillar of nato . 
in this way other eu member states could keep to their traditional peacekeeping activities . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union has yet to substantiate adequately its claim to exercise responsibility for peace and above all for lasting stability in the world . 
yet the union would be unrivalled in that domain if only it would improve the existing instruments and especially its present potential for civilian conflict prevention and apply them coherently . 
the unfortunate fact is that the trauma of kosovo was followed by a hectic flurry of activity which was channelled in an entirely wrong direction . 
concentration on purely reactive crisis management has thrown the common foreign and security policy totally out of synch . 
no government would take responsibility for sending its country 's troops into a region on an open - ended assignment without clear political objectives . 
but there are no clear political objectives , and there is still effectively no common foreign and security policy . 
national interests continue to prevail , especially when diplomatic activity is on the agenda . 
we have just seen the examples in the hague . 
we have the example of the middle east conflict . 
it is absurd to detach european foreign policy from the institutions responsible for most of the instruments that are essential to its pursuit . 
these are not my own words ; they were spoken by commissioner patten , and he is perfectly correct . 
it is equally absurd to concentrate the bulk of the available financial resources on military equipment . 
if we perceive european foreign policy as nothing more than a support instrument for european arms - manufacturing consortia , we have completely misunderstood its function . 
it can only recover credibility if the civilian approach is its supreme guiding principle , if the instruments at its disposal are used in pursuit of effective prevention and if those instruments receive a level of funding that maintains their credibility . 
neglect of this wide range of instruments of non - military conflict prevention would turn out to be a mistake in the long run , and in that respect i am dissatisfied with the council 's statements to the effect that we have already taken decisions , but that things will move in this general direction . 
this is by no means certain , because it is also apparent that these decisions are based entirely on the reactive approach . 
civilian conflict prevention , and i stress the word ' prevention ' , cannot be a mere appendage of military intervention . 
it will not be fully effective until we have overcome the trauma of kosovo and srebrenica , until we return to a policy of active prevention and begin to deploy our available resources long before the alarm bells start ringing and until we are fully committed to defusing potential crises and eliminating possible causes of escalation . 
this means that curbing arms exports to unstable regions must be the first aim for the council to pursue , that trade policies must be fair , that assistance must be given to encourage the sustainable development of countries in volatile regions and , above all , that the democratic forces in civil society must be supported . 
the promotion of regional cooperation is another valuable instrument . 
secondly , nato should be gradually winding down rather than engaging in eastward enlargement . 
mr president , today we are debating two politically important reports , both of which basically concern the cfsp . 
as it takes shape , the cfsp will experience numerous ups and downs ; however , it will help realise our dream of a political europe . 
it could be said that the public debate on these issues has broadened . 
in addition to the diversity of opinions , i feel that there is a prevailing awareness that europe is at an historic moment which requires its role in the international system to be clarified . 
the perception of the importance attached by the european public to the common foreign and security policy is , in fact , borne out by the recent findings of eurobarometer . 
although we all agree that priority should be given to conflict prevention and to the devastating effects of other types of disaster , the european union will only be taken seriously if it also provides itself with military support capabilities for humanitarian interventions . 
the progress that we are making in this field must , however , make us extremely thorough . 
greater clarification and definition are needed at every stage of the creation of common instruments for military defence , from the methods of participation to command , and in the responsibilities that should be given to the various countries . 
in all of these , preventive civil crisis management is a better approach than the military option . 
my fear is that a rapid armed reaction force will be used more and more often instead of civil crisis management , and more and more rapidly . 
the european flag is not to be promoted by means of a tank but by social equality , and therein lies a difference of principle . 
i suggest that we organise as effective a rapid reaction civil crisis management centre as has now been planned . 
then we will be acting in accordance with priorities and our own philosophy . 
so we decided on a method of looking at the entire issue , without any overlaps . 
that method was respected and involved us in a major consultation process . 
it enabled us to take a common approach , which respected each committee 's terms of reference while seeking a real , underlying consistency among our reports . 
however , i want to point out that the pse considers it essential for the reform to respect the treaties in a very pragmatic way . 
the cohesion between all the reform sectors should assure the people of europe that the methods by which european integration is managed politically are clearly visible and truly transparent . 
obviously the modernisation of a structure as complex as the commission requires diplomacy , patience and trust on the part of the various players , and particularly the staff . 
that is why we want to ensure that this process is not imposed from above ; we consider it crucial that all the staff are effectively associated in this whole process of modernisation . 
although it may be led from the top , the reform must be clear and visible to the unions , to all the staff , who must be effectively associated in this whole process . 
we are firmly resolved to give a new dynamism to the european civil service , but that means we must respect certain principles : the european civil service must continue to be governed by a single set of interinstitutional staff regulations , which ensure that every official is recruited at the same basic grade and provide for real mobility , access to real training . 
moreover , over and above all other considerations , we will be even more careful in future to ensure that the commission really does spend the adopted budget on implementing the various political priorities our parliament has democratically decided , rather than reallocating it on the basis of functional weaknesses . 
the package of measures proposed in the white paper must help modernise the whole way the commission functions and make it more efficient . 
we will support it and ensure that these procedures lead , as soon as possible , to a management culture geared to results and performance criteria , taking account of the cost - benefit ratio but also of our political priorities , and remembering that decentralisation and delegation of authority are essential tools , provided that power of decision and of supervision are guaranteed . 
the communication from the european commission must deliver a common message to the various institutions . 
in concrete terms , it is crucial to review the procedures for honouring the budget votes . 
the non - execution of the budget , the excessive delay between inclusion in the budget and commitment , and then the payment of appropriations , is a caricature . 
it is extremely urgent to find ad hoc procedures to restore credibility to the commission 's activities . 
that means we must review the procedures and fix realistic objectives so that the backlog can be cleared rapidly and the delay between commitments and payments , which undermines the credibility of a large part of the budget , can be reduced . we must also provide for the suspension of contracts if there is no longer any consistency between budget appropriations and political commitments , and for paying subsidies and commitments at an early date . 
the credibility of the commission , and therefore of the european union , depends on its ability to reform its financial management systems very quickly . 
an annual evaluation of the changes in the functioning of the commission and of the additional cost of this reform requires consultation at the beginning of each financial year . 
that measure will take time , but it is inevitable and crucial to the reform . 
the introduction of global management by project must be accompanied by a new nomenclature to ensure transparent management . 
we are very much in favour of that . 
we will make sure that all the technical provisions can be implemented on the basis of full respect for parliament 's rights as an arm of the budgetary authority . 
our committee was very pleased to see the conclusions of the bourlanges report on externalisation taken up in the letter of amendment . 
however , in regard to commitology , the member states all too often promote national interests that are at odds with those of the community and consultation of their committees slows down the decision - making process and increases the cost . 
so the reform must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved . 
i shall not dwell on the question of human resources since mr harbour has addressed it . 
the commission 's human resources are obviously not up to the new tasks entrusted to it , in addition to those it will have to assume in the future , and the redeployment proposed in the letter of amendment , which only relates to 4 % of staff , will not resolve the human resources problem either . 
in accepting the substance of the letter of amendment during the budgetary consultation procedure last thursday , the council proved that the other arm of the budgetary authority did in fact wish to support the reform of our commission . 
the questions of audit , management and financial control are basically dealt with in mr pomés ruiz 's report . 
the commission 's position on the recasting of the financial regulation has been known since 22 november . 
we expressed our views on the reform of the fast - track procedure in the vote on the van hulten report . 
yet we would point out again that it is absolutely vital to guarantee independent financial control . 
moreover , it is totally illogical for the council alone to be able to amend the financial regulation and we repeat our call for conciliation on this issue . 
the reform of the commission is crucial to the future of our institutions . 
the working method chosen by the conference of presidents , which some found rather risky , took time . 
but looking at the four reports as a whole , this period of consultation has allowed us to take both a broader and a closer view , which has increased the value of parliament 's opinion . 
second important point : the commission is the only institution that can coordinate all the activities relating to the preparation and follow - up of european decisions . 
lastly , it is also time to look at the union 's external representation . 
we discussed that during this afternoon 's debate on the common foreign policy . 
here too we have reached the borderline between what aspects come under good governance and what may justify measures of institutional reform , questions that were raised by commissioner patten . 
the committee on constitutional affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the union 's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies , and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service . 
the debate on governance is thus launched . 
we will continue it in spring on the basis of the nice conclusions and the new commission proposals . 
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we would like to begin by thanking mrs guy - quint in particular for seeking consensus throughout the process of drawing up her report . 
as the committee on budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget by activities causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the european parliament as a budgetary authority . 
we have just come from a budgetary negotiation with the council , as mrs guy - quint is well aware , where the hardest thing has been to determine in a clearer and more precise way what the limits of budgetary power are for one party or another . 
the committee on budgets considers that parliament must not lose its control over the allocation of administrative appropriations . 
our fears are not greatly allayed by the fact that , when the establishment of the budget by activities is over , category 5 of the financial perspectives will disappear . 
we are not speaking against these consequences , but in favour of safeguarding the budgetary powers of this parliament . 
therefore , any tendency of the commission reform to covertly remove from parliament this ability to control administrative expenditure would create interinstitutional problems in the short term . 
with regard to the taos and the transitional period for their dismantling , my group insists that the commission should make the greatest possible effort to limit that transitional period . 
we therefore ask the commissioner : can the commission guarantee a truly limited transitional period ? 
finally , we must deal with the thorny issue of the proposal on early retirement . 
we are awaiting a three - way dialogue to define this question , amongst others , before the final approval of the 2001 budget . 
my group does not reject the idea of this proposal on early retirement being obligatory . 
we believe that the lack of definition of the current proposal could create more problems than advantages and we have already received some indications of concern from various officials . 
mr president , firstly , i would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work . 
improving eu administration is one of most important reforms of this parliamentary term . 
the main objective of the reform of the commission must be a reduction in bureaucracy , increased efficiency and an end to financial confusion . 
this means simplifying ways of working , devolving power downwards , and a better definition of the power of decision . 
the key to reform is to increase and emphasise the importance of personal responsibility . 
people in positions of responsibility within the institutions must bear both the legal and financial responsibility for their decisions . 
an institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices . 
bearing responsibility will mean ending the advance monitoring of financing . 
if there is more than one decision - maker , nobody clearly bears the responsibility . 
administrative reform is particularly necessary to improve financial transactions in the european union . 
the same practice needs to be followed in the payment of eu bills as in the outside world . 
the current three - month term is too long , let alone the fact that many payments are delayed for more than a year . 
that is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the eu itself is a champion of modernised business practice . 
my group firmly supports administrative reform . 
mr president , my group , the greens / european free alliance , also support the reform of the commission as set out in the white paper , and we urge its speedy implementation . 
time and again in today 's debate on nice , we heard that the eu is facing enormous challenges and that the enlargement of the eu to an eventual total of 27 or more member states will test the resilience of the european institutions . 
with regard to ' whistle - blowers ' , i should like to subscribe to mr van hulten 's earlier remarks . 
on this matter too , we should have welcomed a less diffident approach from the commission and greater courage on its part to address this problem openly , because whistle - blowers , of course , contributed in no small measure to the fact that reform process was finally set in motion . 
as far as we are concerned , the only reform possible was put forward by the socialist group when it tabled 3 amendments to the bösch report , which we discussed during the last part - session . 
i will close by touching on the commitology . 
according to the committee of independent experts , the committees of the representatives of the member states tend in practice to become a mechanism through which national interests are represented in the implementation of community policies , sometimes to the point where they become a forum for dividing up the booty of community funds . 
in our opinion , on this issue , the commission sees nothing , hears nothing and sometimes speaks in a whisper if at all . 
with regard to the commission reform , we feel that the disparity between declared goals and accomplished facts is clear . 
mr president , in his letter to the romans , the apostle paul exhorts his readers to allow themselves to be transformed by the renewing of their minds . 
this process of transformation is necessary to be able to truly serve god and cannot be enforced by rules . 
commissioner kinnock is trying , by changing and improving the rules , to give the commission officials an enhanced sense of responsibility . 
as sound as the intention behind the rules may be , ultimately it all revolves around the implementation of these rules . 
the new rules must therefore be tested as to their feasibility . 
at the deepest level , this reform process is about a change of attitude and behaviour on the part of the commission and its officials . 
this change of attitude should find expression in openness of government . 
the reform plans still leave a lot to be desired on that score . 
in view of its limited budget , the commission will have to make choices in its task package . 
we must choose between deepening or enlarging the union . 
the years to come will be dominated by the issue of enlargement . 
it is therefore astounding that the rapporteurs mrs guy - quint and mr pomés ruiz completely pass over this and merely regard the reform process as a means of achieving european political integration . 
i believe that the reform of the commission should be seen in the context of enlargement , and that is what it must be guided by . 
i would like to pick up on the some 26 amendments which have been made to the harbour report . 
as you would expect we are supporting amendments nos 1 to 6, submitted by the pse . 
we shall however be withdrawing amendment no 6 and asking for a split vote on the latter part of amendment no 15 as we do not believe the current system within the ecb lends itself to this situation . 
we would ask that amendments nos 20 and 23 be taken as additions , as in paragraph 10 it would be utter folly to delete the involvement in drawing up the job goals and the personnel development role of the appraisal system . 
amendment no 23 looks like it was an afterthought and while we are not against it , it should not replace the existing paragraph 22 . 
we are supporting amendments nos 13, 14, 16 and 9 submitted by the ppe . 
we are opposing the rest of the amendments as they either add nothing to the report or basically take us off into flights of fantasy . 
i would like to say something quickly about change . 
change is never easy . 
we must bear in mind that the community administration is based on certain principles , which are well established in continental administration , such as the principle of a job for life and stable employment . 
these principles were established after a previous period in which public appointments resulted from the distribution of influences , from the system of cherry picking and string pulling . 
in light of this , the system of stable public administration offered a guarantee that political changes would not affect the functioning of the administration . 
in some countries , such as spain , where our political life has been through tempestuous times , the administration , at least , has been a guarantee of stability . 
however , we feel that we ought to respect two fundamental principles ; one , the recognition of situations that are recognised in law ; the so - called acquired rights of officials and secondly , the principle of stability , of guarantee , and even the right to union membership , the right to the defence , by officials , of their post , their career and even their professional prestige . 
with this consideration , we urge the commission and mr kinnock to move ahead with their efforts at reform . 
delays in payment are mounting up and the bureaucratic obstacles are well known . 
we are all familiar with the consequences of this situation and it has tested the dedication and skill of the many people working in the commission and in its administration . 
it is crucial that the commission makes the best use of existing human resources and promotes new recruitment . 
with regard to this last aspect , the executive role of the commission must be strengthened , above all , by a reform of commitology . 
let us be clear on this matter : if , under the terms of article 274 of the treaty , the commission alone is responsible for implementing the budget , then some interventions by member states through management and regulatory committees , which have basically been put forward to express national interests , must be seen as hampering the commission 's ability to manage efficiently . 
issues such as the bse crisis , oil prices , and the greenhouse effect have a distinctly european dimension . 
so the commission has an important task to fulfil in this respect . 
it will only be possible to achieve results for the citizens if the commission is able to act swiftly and transparently , and be accountable to this public service , among other things . 
so this is what the goal of the reforms taking place within the commission must be . 
we have all seen how the culture of fear has rather paralyse. totally paralysed i might sa. the decision - making processes within the commission , and by that i also mean the departments and the officials . 
the field of external relations , for example , exemplifies the major problems that the commission is unfortunately still struggling with . 
many thousands of project applications have been awaiting assessment for over a year now . 
letters and requests for information as to the state of play are either dealt with half - heartedly or not at all . 
now is the time to close the chapter on fraud , bureaucracy and the fall of the commission once and for all . 
let us open a new book on a modern european public service that fulfils its constitutional role in the proper manner , is ready for the forthcoming enlargement and lastly , which embraces service provision for the european public as its new mission statement . 
thank you very much , mr vice - president . 
this activity - related approach is designed to harmonise resources more closely with political priorities . 
it is an instrument with which expenditure can be more accurately estimated and recorded , and it is also a straightforward management tool which can channel managerial activity in a more focused manner on the basis of priorities . 
it was , after all , one of the main concerns of this very parliament that political priorities should be made more clearly identifiable . 
i see that we have evidently launched the reform process in good time , because it is not quite five to twelve yet ! 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
the joint debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m . 
the ppe group will vote for mrs sauquillo 's report , while hoping the amendments it has tabled can be incorporated . 
mr president , one in five people in the world has no access to basic social provisions . 
we want to work towards a culture of greater accountability . 
we want to see ex - post control . 
we want to see increased accountability for the public service and we want to see decentralisation . 
we want to see a european development fund become integral to parliament . 
we want clearer objectives . 
parliament foresaw all this in terms of its role in the draft budget for 2001 . 
we will come back to that later because that in itself constitutes a sound framework . 
we have our doubts about the technical mould in which the reforms are now being cast . 
we think it is more important to have a clear distribution of political tasks : a parliament with clear objectives , a commission with a clear idea of what it wants , a commissione. and i fully support mrs sauquillo in thi. who has hundred per cent responsibility for the whole world when it comes to development policy , and who is given full responsibility for this within the commission , and also the human resources they need , because without these human resources it is of course absolutely impossible to implement this policy . 
to briefly sum up : let us put an end to this culture of fear , also amongst the officials . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i fully support mrs sauquillo 's report , commending the hard work put in and the contribution it makes to the changes to the committee on development and cooperation . 
if , as is hoped in the explanatory statement , the reform brings about greater involvement of the european parliament , we will have to establish a sort of policy which does not merely stop at money or budget headings , which , in practice , take the form of tangible aid to less developed countries . 
aid does not just mean donating money but providing practical assistance in times of difficulty or for things which they would not be able to do themselves or without assistance . 
poverty and need are not just the product of economic backwardness and development problems but are often the result of aggression and the exploitation of the weak by the strong , of the selfishness of the capable in the face of the weakness of the marginalised . 
before we start to talk about aid to projects , we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation , identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need . 
the reformed commission must establish a project , before dispensing aid , to investigate the causes which have created or contributed to creating a state of discomfort among the poor peoples . 
we often talk about cancelling the debt of the less developed countries . 
the phrase would lead us to believe that it is an act of altruism or great generosity but , when all is said and done , it may be merely an act of justice . 
the commission must also ensure that this happens at international level . 
in this way , quality of life will improve and the gap between the poor , who are becoming increasingly poorer , and the very rich , who are exploiting these situations and becoming increasingly richer , will be lessened . 
reform of external assistance " yes " , sufficient staff numbers to manage projects " yes " , decentralisation to delegations " yes " , increased emphasis on programming , movement to ex post financial assessment , streamlined comitology arrangements " yes " , " yes " , " yes " . 
late at night , when we have to be clear , even blunt and when my esteemed colleague , mrs sauquillo pérez del arco , has had to use the instrument of an own - initiative report to ensure parliamentary accountability , the commission should listen when european parliament says " no " . 
first , the emasculation of dg development will deform not reform external assistance . 
it is precisely because mr nielson is loyal to that collegiate responsibility that he will doubtless defend the proposal tonight . 
so i hope others in the commission will hear us when we say we have a highly effective development commissioner . 
let us give him the political responsibility to do the job . 
i assure that i will do my best to keep parliament informed of policy proposals and i welcome the invitation to the commission to report regularly to this parliament on the reform of the external service . 
thank you very much indeed for your contribution , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m . 
( the sitting was closed at 12.30 a.m ) . 
safety at sea 
the next item is the joint debate on the council and commission statements on maritime safety and the following reports : 
report ( a5 - 0343 / 2000 ) by mr watts , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending council directive 95 / 21 / ec concerning the enforcement , in respect of shipping using community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the member states , of international standards for ship safety , pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions ( port state control ) [ com ( 2000 ) 14 . 
c5 - 0174 / 200 . 
2000 / 0065 ( cod ) ] 
what we can no longer accept is the logic which makes the quest for the lowest price the operational rule of maritime transport . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , rapporteurs , as you see , here we have the opportunity to enhance the safety of maritime transport . 
we all know that these measures , which you are going to be debating today , are inadequate . 
the heads of state and government highlighted the urgent need to examine a second package of proposals relating to the supervision and transparency of maritime transport and to the establishment of a european agency , and to making all actors involved in the maritime transport of hazardous or toxic substances aware of their responsibilities . 
what is more , on this occasion france reaffirmed the need to set in motion a community project on the training and working conditions of seamen , and i know that some of you also share this concern . 
we have taken this message very seriously indeed and it is exceptional that the commission has acted so quickly and so consistently with six different legislative proposals within a year covering very different issues . 
all lie at the very heart of the regulations of shipping as a whole and i want to remind you that , in addition to the three proposals which are to be discussed here today , the ' erika ii ' package , as mr gayssot has already mentioned , will be put on the table next week . 
this set of measures will propose the creation of a european maritime safety agency , a new european system for the adequate compensation of oil pollution victims and a new traffic surveillance system for eu waters . 
this swift and focused approach resulting in the two ' erika ' packages and six proposals has created an enormous momentum . 
i believe it is fair to say that only after the erika disaster did member states and the international maritime community fully understand and feel the determination of the european institutions to improve maritime safety . 
they have realised that the determination remains even if such actions involve friction between the eu and the international maritime institutions and tension with the economic interests of the maritime industry . 
now that there are commission proposals on the table we must not lose this momentum and forget the issue until the next accident happens . 
in order to make a real change for maritime safety , the three institutions , but in particular the two co - legislators , must adopt the texts . 
finally , i wish to thank this house and in particular the rapporteurs , mr hatzidakis , mr ortuondo larrea , ms mckenna and mr watts , for their understanding of the importance of the first ' erika ' package which is evidenced by the excellent work already done in such a limited time , and for the generally good cooperation between parliament and the commission in the field of maritime safety . 
madam president , in a few days time europe will mark the first anniversary of the loss of the oil tanker , erika . 
that is why this morning we cannot agree with the commission 's proposal but we are putting forward four proposals which we believe will significantly strengthen the proposal and would therefore secure this parliament 's support . 
firstly , we agree that there needs to be enhanced compulsory inspections of the most dangerous ships . 
we all agree on that , but we have to find the methodology by which that particular priority can be implemented , and we have yet to secure an agreement between the three institutions on that . 
i think it is within sight but we need to be sure that this agreement will be enforced . 
secondly , we make a demand again this morning for ' black box ' style voyage data recorders to be fitted , not on just some ships or new ships , or in 10 or 20 years time , or whenever the imo eventually agrees . 
we want black boxes in all ships as soon as possible . 
that is a very clear , fundamental demand , which we are not willing to compromise on . 
for small tankers , we have adopted a compromise position between the 5000 - tonne limit set by the éìï and the 600 - tonne limit set by the commission . 
we have reconciled the need for safety with the need to supply certain regions of europe , such as island regions especially . 
madam president , i think that we have taken a step forward today , a fundamental step forward . 
parliament has taken a clear and unequivocal stand on the commission 's proposals , we are at the council 's disposal , in the hope , i repeat , that this issue will be brought to a close as quickly as possible , because all of us here , the council , the commission and the house , are acutely aware of the importance of this issue . 
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the erika accident on 12 december of last year and the ievoli sun accident more recently clearly revealed the limits of the action of some classification and inspection societies in terms of monitoring the construction and , above all , the seaworthiness of vessels that are under their responsibility by delegation from the flag states . 
with this in mind , and in order to remove the obvious differences that exist on an international level between the various classification societies in terms of the competence of their inspectors , the level of development of their it resources and the degree of technical requirements in their inspections , the commission has presented us with a proposal to amend directive 94 / 57 / ec which will apply to all vessels , including those transporting oil products , and which establishes the rules that the member states , and the classification societies authorised by them , should comply with . 
in this respect , there is a commitment to improving the quality of vessel inspections as a measure to prevent maritime accidents . 
on the one hand , it is stipulated that the classification societies must have their own system of internal audits in order to measure the quality of their services in all the locations where they work , as well as clear rules for the responsibility and monitoring of all its branches and staff . 
the region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world . 
there are several tragic examples of accidental marine pollution from tankers and other ships carrying other forms of dangerous cargoes . 
as we have just heard , two of the most recent were the italian chemical tanker , which sank in the english channel , and also the maltese registered oil tanker , the erika , which sank off the coast of brittany causing major environmental havoc . 
in terms of the environment , whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no consequence , the environmental impact remains . 
furthermore , although the direct dumping of industrial materials , including military dumps of redundant munitions , is largely a practice which has been abandoned by member states , the sights of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases a threat to human safety . 
often fishermens ' lives are at risk , as is the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea . 
the transboundary nature of the marine environment , which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region , leads to the need for a community - wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution . 
sharing information regarding hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful materials carried at sea or discharged into the sea , or which have been dumped as part of a historical dumping regime , is a vital prerequisite to facilitating the preparation and coordination of any responses necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents . 
effective mitigation requires a rapid response . 
the longer an accident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact . 
hence , it is too late to start trying to get information after an accident has actually occurred . 
knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques , personnel and equipment at appropriate locations . 
it is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessment of the risks . 
the public 's trust in the authorities is important and must be ensured with adequate responses . 
furthermore , the public have a right to know what preparations have been made , what types of material are threatening and what impacts are to be expected . 
to this end , publication of information is a vital component in the establishment of a way for the general public to obtain information , emergency phone contact numbers , etc . 
during the conciliation procedure the european parliament delegation was able to reach a compromise with the council , which is close to the original amendments on all the major questions . 
the definition of accidental marine pollution includes a reference to munitions dumping . 
a definition of harmful substances in line with the water framework directive was added in order to cover but not , unfortunately , explicitly mention radioactive substances . 
the cooperation includes exchange of information and mapping of munitions dump sites . 
the polluter - pays principle is recognised , and the member states should take this into account in order to provide compensation for damages . 
nature protection organisations are also included in cooperation at local level . 
nonetheless , we must be aware that these proposals which , as highlighted by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , are essentially a response to the legal requirements which have been identified in the areas defined by their respective objectives will only be effective insofar as they are correctly implemented by the member states and monitored by the commission . 
i would therefore like to highlight the points which , i feel , cannot be ignored if , following the adoption of these regulations and this directive , the expected progress is to be achieved . 
first of all , the action of member states must be translated into action integrated at european level . 
we must deploy adequate numbers of properly trained people , used to cooperation , whatever their country of origin , and to using similar equipment . 
in order for member states to enforce existing legislation , they must allocate sufficient resources to inspections so as to ensure the proper application of international conventions and the directive amended by the european parliament . 
i believe your intentions are honourable , but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the council . 
to that extent , it is impossible to change anything , because we discussed this material meticulously in our committees , and it would be impossible to hammer out a compromise wording on the various issues that are particularly awkward , to have these compromises printed in eleven languages and to discuss them with our colleagues in time for next tuesday . 
we are prepared to negotiate on proposed compromises for the second reading from january onwards , so that the second reading will be completed early next year , just like that . 
i would just like to take a minute to go into the report by mr watts . 
if a flag state defaults , then the port state must be given increased responsibility . 
it has been inspected three times in the last three years . 
so , there is more to safety than rules . 
eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub - standard in terms of safety , and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances . 
in the accident barometer measured against the gauge of shipwrecks the traditional mercury has been replaced by oil or residual acid . 
faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport , europe has taken up the challenge and , just 11 months after the loss of the erika , will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly . 
this powerful political signal is in our hands . 
it is up to us to adopt the ' erika i ' package and it is up to the council to accept its final amendments . 
in responding favourably to this acceleration of the timetable , our group has not , however , given up on the fundamental demands for the enhanced safety of the marine environment . 
the revisions of the directives concerning port and ship inspections should get rid of the lame ducks as far as the classification societies are concerned and appreciably increase the number of inspectors in the member states , provided , however , that the latter provide adequate resources to achieve this . 
but we are also waiting impatiently for the second package , ' erika ii ' , with the establishment of a maritime agency and outline plans for a european coastguard . 
the coasts of france are not there to become a dumping ground for european maritime traffic nor receive munitions , crude oil and styrene on their shores . 
mr president , safety is a serious issue for various forms of transport . 
more than 40 000 people die in road accidents every year , and although the victims of shipping disasters are fewer in number , each human life counts , and what is more , the natural world is coming under increasing threat owing to accidents at sea . 
flora and fauna , in particular birds , are the victims of oil and other forms of pollution . 
it is sad that a tanker had to be wrecked off the french coast , with disastrous consequence , before the package of measures now on the table was put together . we are very satisfied with this set of measures , as we are with the various reports . 
i will confine my comments to the watts report on port state control . 
as the rapporteur very rightly points out , the condition of a tanker is more indicative than its age . 
i also support his demand for compulsory voyage data recorders . 
his regime for ships that have been detained several times or that fly a flag which has been on the blacklist for three years , makes a great deal of sense . 
what i would ask though , is what percentage of the ships should be refused at the present time on the basis of these criteria ? 
neither the size nor the status of such a flag state , for example an candidate country , must result in the undermining of the measures . 
today , a large number of texts are being put to us , and there are yet others to come . 
i therefore support the initiatives for a european maritime platform . 
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteurs for their sterling work . 
it is absolutely imperative to ensure , taking the environment , safety , fishing communities , and tourism into account , that we do not have a repeat performance of what happened before . 
all eyes were on the erika in the first instance , but a tanker was sinking in other waters off turkey at the same time . 
the ievoli sun was double - hull but contained chemicals in a particular form . 
mr gayssot , greek ships have sunk without warning , when there were no storms in the vicinity . 
in short , as i understand , there are reasons besides storms in the channel that should prompt us to consider stopping shipping traffic there . 
at the end of the day , we are talking about eight to ten thousand sub - standard ships . 
in other words , this is a very extensive problem . 
the age of ships is a factor , but not the most important one . 
maintenance plays a very important part . 
it turns out that two texts risk putting us at odds with the council and so , this evening , it is likely that the imminent publication of directives and regulations , which everybody is hoping for , will not be announced . 
there is , however , still much to be done to improve safety at sea . 
it is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further , and enhance its effectiveness . 
we also have to improve the way we approve classification societies and monitor their work , and expanded inspections must be carried out , in particular on high - risk vessels . 
i would also like to point out that it is not enough that the union alone should find solutions to increase safety at sea . 
for example , questions of responsibility must be dealt with on a global basis . 
that also goes for the matter of double - hull design requirements . 
rules applied regionally are not enough here either : we need global imo agreements . 
for example , for finland it is vitally important that russia is included in these agreements . 
mr president , i shall be voting in favour of all the technical measures aimed at enhancing maritime safety even though , at the same time , i deplore their inadequacy . 
but the real problem is the political will to adopt and implement measures binding upon all those endangering the community and the environment in order to make a profit . 
these are not only the shipowners but also , more especially , the contractors , who are large multinationals , as the losses of the erika and the ievoli sun clearly illustrated . 
these binding measures should involve not only the detention of dangerous ships but also the seizure of such vessels and their contents . 
what is more , these major companies should be made financially liable to the extent of their assets for any damage that they cause . 
the fuel dumps of total and shell , the charterers of the erika and the ievoli sun respectively , should have been immediately confiscated until all the damage that had been inflicted due to their irresponsibility had been fully compensated . 
justice can be merciless towards the poor who are unable to pay a tax or a fine , and will even go so far as to seize their meagre belongings . 
laxness towards large companies is indeed a sign that they are more powerful than elected institutions . 
neither can estonia act , because the vessel did not cause any damage there . 
malta , for its part , probably does not wish to act , because the country enjoys great economic gain from this type of vessel being registered under the maltese flag . 
ladies and gentlemen , let us ensure that the " polluter pays " slogan does not remain just a slogan ! 
mr president , minister , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , transport by sea is undoubtedly one of the least environmentally damaging modes of transport . 
this is demonstrated by the fact that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have certainly had some success . 
nevertheless , we still unfortunately witness serious incidents , such as the recent sinking of the erika , which show how urgent it is to adopt new measures to promote marine safety and to avoid any repetition of incidents that have such major ecological and economic repercussions on our coastlines , our seas , fisheries and tourism . 
with regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety , i can only congratulate the three rapporteurs , who in a very short time have shown how determined our parliament is to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea , controls and construction standards , and that it is no longer tolerable that similar incidents should occur again . 
i believe it is our duty to strengthen the enforcement of existing directives on these matters and to adopt new measures designed to clear our seas of sub - standard vessels , real sea - going old rust buckets . 
in conclusion , i would highlight the need to set up an information exchange system among the member states on navigation safety in areas with heavy tanker traffic , so as to ensure constant monitoring and an immediate reaction to any hazards . 
allow me to make a comment on portugal , which has been mentioned here . 
portugal supported the changes to directive 94 / 54 but disagrees with the abolition of classification societies by smaller countries . 
classification society performance must be assessed by common criteria : number of accidents , incidents or detentions of inspected and certified ships that cause pollution . 
it is unrealistic to expect the number of accidents to fall without international coordination channelled through a political and entrepreneurial commitment that creates a new operational mentality . 
mrs chairman , a series of high - profile ship disasters , particularly involving oil tankers , has hit our continent in the recent past . 
tremendous damage has been caused to nature as well as to the livelihoods of the population living in these areas . 
our electors ask us what we are doing to prevent catastrophes like these ? 
i would like to thank ms wallström and ms de palacio for the action they have taken in the field of maritime safety . 
they definitely have reacted quickly and worked swiftly for better rules and legislation regarding safety at sea in both the ' erika i ' and ' erika ii ' proposals . 
the phasing out of single - hull oil tankers will increase safety along eu coasts . 
my friends in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism remarked that stricter eu phase - out dates should be adopted . 
i thank my colleagues for this responsible approach and i urge agreement to be reached on the earlier drop - dead date of 2015 . 
when we do this we should always remember that double hulls or even triple hulls do not guarantee with absolute certainty that accidents will not happen in the future . 
presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work . 
as regards the commission decision yesterday to stick with the previously agreed timetable regarding the state aid schemes i think that was a wise decision . 
it is true that the subjects we are dealing with are sometimes complex and technical . 
i realise that even the translations take time . 
but the most important thing is the unshakeable will which must motivate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to establish maritime safety . 
these proposals which , i hope , we are going to push forward together very quickly , both as regards the phasing out of single - hull ships and the issue of classification societies and port state control , are important , but , as you have said , and as the commissioner has also said , we know that they are not enough . 
we need this second package in order to go further in terms of making all the operators aware of their responsibilities . we also need to step up surveillance and transparency . 
one member of parliament used the term ' traceability ' . 
i would support that idea . 
we cannot allow operators to do just what they like with ships , especially when they have been repaired or banned in such and such a place . 
it is important that everybody knows what happened , as the human question , which was brought up by a number of you , is also very important . 
the port state control directive is designed to check compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules . 
within a few days the commission will adopt a proposal for a directive on safety of navigation including such an obligation to be equipped with a black box . 
the third element of amendment no 3 is a proposal to ban all ships that have flown for three years the flag of a state included in the blacklist published by the paris memorandum of understanding . 
should the directive enter into force today with the proposed amendment of parliament , 32 fleets including malta , cyprus , russia , panama , the largest fleet of the world , would be banned . 
this means thousands of ships including ships of high quality which is contrary to the objectives of port state control . 
more specifically , amendments nos 9 to 17 and 25 introduce new recitals most of which are not linked in any way to the text of the directive . 
amendment no 18 introduces port state control in relation to the seafarers ' rest period , however the enforcement of the provisions in respect of seafarers ' hours of work is already fully covered by existing directive 99 / 95 . 
amendment no 19 is redundant since the current procedures already provide that non - compliance with the required health and working standards as established by ilo conventions are reported as deficiencies and can also lead to the detention of a vessel . 
amendment no 20 is irrelevant to port state control as it concerns competition between ports of the atlantic and north sea and not maritime safety . 
amendment no 26 reflects the amendments of banding proposed by the rapporteur in amendment no 3 but extends the scope of the measure to the exclusive economic zone of member states and in this light it is contrary to the law of the sea . 
let me now turn to the proposal for the accelerated phasing in of double - hull oil tankers . 
i am happy to say that we almost entirely agree . 
following pressure by member states on the international maritime organisation , there is a proposed phase - out schedule which meets the main concerns of europe and at the same time aligns with the american oil pollution act 90 and which is to be fully supported . 
in this respect , the commission insists on 2015 as the final end date . 
in order to achieve the main objective of this proposal , namely to phase out old single - hull oil tankers quickly , we are prepared to go along with the deletion of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues . 
it is expected that the imo will formally adopt the phase out schedule at its april meeting next year . 
however , should the international maritime organisation fail to do so , the commission agrees with parliament that we will have to adopt a eu regulation based on the ep text and introduce a system for european union waters . 
amendment no 12 of the report says exactly the same , but it is more of a political commitment than a legal text . 
therefore , we do not need it in the final text and i hope you will not insist on this point . 
for similar reasons , the commission cannot accept the new amendment no 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation . 
the commission also rejects amendments nos 10 and 18 since this would mean setting up an additional committee just for this regulation and this is inconsistent with our policy line of reducing the number of committees by making use of existing committees . 
i am happy to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in amendment no 21 to the condition assessment scheme and we agree with the main thrust of the approach suggested but there is need for some fine tuning of the wording to make it clearer . 
last but not least , the proposal for amendments to the classification societies directive . 
here again , there is no great divergence of views and the commission can accept amendments nos 6, 12, 14, 15 and 8 with the exception of the additional paragraphs 3a and 3b to that amendment . 
there is a set of amendments which the commission feels could create confusion because they introduce new terminology in an area where the language of the international fora , imo , is well established . 
i am referring to amendments nos 2, 3, 7 and 9 and the commission feels that these are not really substantial problems , more drafting language matters which could possibly be cleared by the jurist - linguists . 
the issue of assessments to be carried out over the classification societies by the member states on the one hand and by the commission on the other is of primary importance . 
the objectives of parliament and the commission are the same . 
we must maintain the clear difference in substance of the tasks at hand for either party . 
member states must satisfy themselves that the classification society they have chosen to work on their behalf , fulfils the tasks to their full satisfaction . 
secondly , in our proposal on ' erika ii ' concerning surveillance of navigation , member states will be required to intervene even on the high seas in such cases . 
i would say to mrs peijs about cambodia and honduras ships , that we are perfectly aware of the threat to safety and these are precisely the kinds of flags targeted in our proposal on the port state directive . 
i can assure you that if a shipowner thinks of registering a ship on these registers , he should think twice after our proposal . 
may i conclude by expressing once again my gratitude to parliament and to the four rapporteurs for their expeditious work and excellent reports . 
the conciliation process was demanding , but a well - balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of parliament and council have produced a better decision . 
the scope and content of the decision are now clearer , in particular concerning operational discharges and munitions as well as regarding the link with international conventions or in relation to the polluter - pays principle . 
let me conclude by recalling that one month ago the ievoli sun sank near cherbourg with 6 000 tonnes of dangerous cargo . 
once again , this demonstrates how urgent the adoption of strengthened , preventative and restoratory community measures for the protection of our seas is . 
i am told there is no objection to that , mr poos . 
madam president , this is a point of order concerning rule 44 . 
as we have heard on several occasions , the council persists in not taking the deadlines for replying to our questions into consideration . 
instead of supplying a written , priority reply in three weeks , they took 16 weeks to send this one . 
anyway , i should like to read out this very brief reply : " the first four questions raised have never been submitted to the council ; as for the last three questions , these clearly fall within the organisational competences of the general secretariat " . 
thank you , mr napolitano . 
madam president , as the representative of the pensioners ' party i voted against the watts report . 
i voted against in protest at the fact that the european union is still not managing to intervene in this matter as it should . 
in fact , those concerned with enforcing shipboard living and working conditions , as the title of this report states , are unable to lay down that seamen who go to sea are , throughout europe , entitled to receive their pensions and end their working lives earlier than other people . 
many seamen are grandfathers and do not see their grandchildren because they are always at sea ; fathers do not see their own children . 
in short , this job is different from others and entails many more sacrifices than other jobs . 
therefore it is fair that they should be entitled , if they wish , to take their pensions before other workers . 
-- ( nl ) if all the flag states for shipping , all the shipowning companies and all the classification societies had good will , there would be no need for port state controls . 
unfortunately , making maximum profit is often all that matters , to the detriment of safety , the environment and the personnel . 
human error largely results from overloading , underpayment and the fact that the sailors have not received adequate training . 
the commission proposal looks reassuring , but is not proof against deliberate sabotage . 
i therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteurs watts , vachetta and piétrasanta have endeavoured to close the gaps still present in the commission proposal . 
they propose that ships which pose a risk or sail under cheap flags and those lacking voyage recorder data should be banned from eu ports , that we should counteract brass - plate companies , stop ships rinsing out their tanks in the sea , and increase the number of inspectors . 
one can therefore deplore the fact that the commission proposal has not taken up the idea of the establishment of a european surveillance body on the model of the coastguards in the united states . 
we will settle for setting up a european system of surveillance and information exchange between member states . 
the european parliament will have to ensure that the financial and human resources that are needed to effectively establish this rapid reaction and information exchange system are quickly made available by the member states . 
i would point out that the european union has some 270 inspectors charged with state port control . 
this figure falls far short of the number of inspectors needed to implement the measures we are proposing in ports . 
the rapporteur has put forward a number of proposals enhancing the binding nature and effectiveness of these inspections . 
i fully support the ban on navigation for ships which have been detained twice in the course of the preceding 2 years , irrespective of the age of the ship . 
if we had thought of it before , if mr hatzidakis had been here before , in previous years , he would surely have proposed the double - hull design and we would have avoided so many disasters . 
i now ask mr hatzidakis to become the promoter of another initiative , to have double shells adopted also for the road tankers that carry oil and other harmful substances on our motorways . 
. ( el ) we will not achieve safety at sea or protect human life at sea and the environment unless we address the unaccountability of shipowners , introduce strict controls on the state of ships , impose heavy penalties on shipping companies in breach of safety regulations , improve working times for seamen , train them properly and ensure that ships are crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements . 
introducing double - hull ships may help improve safety and protect the environment , but it is not a panacea , nor is it a guarantee , on its own , of seaworthiness . 
we feel that a differential charging system for port and pilotage dues for double - hull oil tankers should not be introduced at the expense of the revenue of the port and other funds to which dues are currently channelled ; on the contrary , dues for double - hull ships should be maintained at present levels and gradually increased for single - hull ships . 
unfortunately , not only do the proposals in the report make no such provision , they also worsen the preconditions for withdrawing old ships . 
we feel that the proposal to increase the tonnage of vessels below the marpol limit which are exempt from the provisions of the commission regulation from 600 to 3 000 tdw will increase the number of ships with the potential to jeopardise safety and environmental protection . 
most of these ships are used in busy shipping areas . 
for these reasons , the meps of the communist party of greece voted against the report . 
-- ( nl ) it would be better if there were no single - hull tankers any longer , but such ships were still being built up until 1996 . 
the commission is right to want to stop europe lagging behind america . 
we must not allow single - hull tankers to carry on sailing in our waters when they are no longer present elsewhere after 2005, 2010 or 2015 . 
if we do not implement the necessary measures in good time we will end up with the old , high - risk ships that have been sent for scrap in the states in our own waters . 
. ( fr ) to unravel the chain of responsibility , to respect shipboard social standards , to re - establish the ' polluter - pays ' principle and to innovate in the field of equipment must be our top priorities . 
in this context , making the construction of double - hull vessels , especially those used to transport toxic and / or dangerous goods , more widespread as quickly as possible is a useful measure . 
europe must not be out of step with regulations in the united states which , thanks to the oil pollution act of 1990, aim to phase out single - hull vessels between 2000 and 2015 . 
we must at least keep pace with the united states while adopting measures not to shift the activities of the whole fleet of coffin ships towards third - world countries . 
moreover , replacing the outdated ships is a means of giving a fresh boost to shipbuilding . 
we must envisage improving the system of double hulls . 
many technical experts have pointed out the difficulties encountered when inspecting the space between the two hulls and during its maintenance . 
yet mr hatzidakis makes proposals which restrict the scope of the commission proposals . 
as he explained , they aim to enhance maritime safety while respecting the system of competition or , in other words , the quest for the lowest cost . 
in short , what is being proposed is to eliminate the lack of maritime safety without attacking its causes . 
this draft directive is moving in the right direction , but we must reject all exemptions and delays in implementation . 
we must stick with the commission proposal . 
in all eventualities , the ultimate deadline of 2015 must be respected . 
the fact is that the unilateral decision taken by the united states to ban single - hull oil tankers from calling at american ports after 2015 poses a real threat to maritime traffic passing through eu waters , where these ships are likely to ply their trade . 
it is therefore crucial that the timetable for eliminating these ships from our seas must be in line with the american timetable . 
finally , we must not forget that the mandatory double hull for oil tankers can be but a single element in a genuine european policy of maritime safety . 
this decision is important but it does not go far enough . 
promoting more stringent regulations at an international level must continue to be the fundamental objective of our maritime safety policy . 
watts report ( a5 - 0343 / 2000 ) and hatzidakis report ( a5 - 0344 / 2000 ) 
first of all , recognition of classification societies is devolved to member states without any prior control or harmonisation at european level . 
what is more , the training of the inspectors of these societies differs from country to country . 
furthermore , no guarantee is given as to the independence of classification societies vis - à - vis the flag administration and / or the client . 
the european union must set aside the resources to make it possible for a recognised and competent authority to enforce standards on classification societies . 
additional financial and human resources will be necessary . 
classification societies will have to be monitored and , where necessary , punished by having their authorisation suspended . 
it is a step in the right direction that the recognition accorded classification societies can be withdrawn , that liability is to be harmonised and that classification societies will always have to transfer their data to the competitor who takes over from them . 
it would be better still if inspections were to take place biannually and if classification societies were not permitted to be dependent on one large company alone , which builds , repairs or utilises ships . 
but the best result of all would be if harmonised inspections were to become the direct responsibility of the government . 
. ( fr ) the report by mr ortuondo larrea is the final section of the package of measures on maritime safety . 
it is an important section as it relates to classification societies . 
finally , our common policy on maritime safety must be an international role model and the obligations we place on our ships must be extended to third - country fleets . 
maritime safety must not simply be an issue arising out of a state of urgency in the wake of each new disaster that hits our shorelines , but the object of an internationally integrated and constant policy . 
preparation for the nice european council 
madam president , the union for a europe of nations group did not endorse the european parliament resolution on the preparation for the 2000 nice european council , since it is inspired totally by the desire to strengthen supranational institutions by applying uniform rules to all member states . 
in particular , we reject calls for a european constitution , at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions . 
of course , you would become a heroine rather than a hero , and anyway we naturally would not wish the same fate on you as robespierre met . 
the increasingly open struggle for power between many member states is clouding the view in terms of possible compromises . 
quite a number of member states , particularly the large ones , seem only to be interested in consolidating their own position of power in the future . 
i have no time for this attitude . 
an ambition for power alone is not enough to prepare the european union for the future . 
the very first thing that is needed if we are to have a european union in which the various nationalities can live peacefully together , is for the governments to seek a sustainable balance , in mutual respect and empathy . 
the institutions of the european union must be in a position to fulfil their tasks without having to step into the shoes of the member states . 
now , and in the future too , each country must be able to truly show itself to best advantage in a union based on justice . 
i believe that is a crucial criterion by which to judge the treaty of nice . 
unfortunately though , i do not see any evidence of this notion in the motions for resolutions . 
i am anticipating complete justice in the future realm of the lord jesus . 
that must not stop us , the people of the european union , from seeking this justice in the here and now , here on earth . 
as we have also made known through the individual votes , we have , throughout the intergovernmental conference , been opposed to the much expanded agenda which , by means of repeated motions for resolutions , the majority in the european parliament has been trying to draw up . 
many of the motions for resolutions tabled by the different political groups are therefore also based upon a deep concern about how much success there will be in achieving the goal in nice , which is to make the eu ready for admitting the new member states of the eu . 
the most important task in nice is to ensure that the eu has effective institutions . 
as a prerequisite , the solution should involve striking a balance between small and large countries , not only where the weighting of votes in the council of ministers is concerned , but also when it comes to the composition of the european parliament and the commission . 
enlargement is a major project requiring backing not only in the applicant states but also in those countries which are already members . 
many members of the european parliament have ambitions to see the treaties made into a constitution , with the charter of fundamental rights included and qualified majority voting used in all areas . 
we have also emphasised this during the individual votes today . 
we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole because we wish to put pressure on the heads of state and government to achieve a good outcome in nice . 
. ( fr ) on the eve of the nice summit and without prejudging the outcome , i want to salute the tremendous work carried out by the french presidency and the majority of ministers who generously put in the time and effort to address parliament on a regular basis both in committee and in parliament . 
while , like many others , i have at times during this semester regretted that we have heard so little from prime minister jospin himself due to reasons of ' cohabitation ' , i am aware of the strong impetus he has always given to his ministers and i should like to state as much . 
i especially want to thank hubert védrine and pierre moscovici , as well as martine aubry , who instigated the social calendar , one of the highlights of this presidency . 
it now remains to make a success of the nice summit and , as regards institutional reform , to persuade each of you to make the final concessions needed to achieve ' a good agreement ' and a good treaty . 
it is also important , of course , that we succeed in providing a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in the treaty itself so as to give it greater legal force . 
the importance of the social agenda must also be highlighted so that it can be implemented speedily . 
a draft directive on public services , whose urgency is no longer contested , must at last be set in motion . 
just one week away from the nice summit i personally have high hopes . 
my voting in favour of the resolution , even though i do not agree with the wording in all cases , is an expression of these hopes . 
. ( sv ) in its resolution , the european parliament , as usual , recommends increased power of codecision for itself . 
it would be good if the european parliament showed just as much enthusiasm for discussing how to go about increasing participation in parliamentary elections to the european parliament . 
in the 1999 election , the participation rate would have been below 40 per cent on average had some member states not had compulsory voting and had national elections not taken place at the same time as this election . 
the enthusiasm that the european parliament shows for increased power of codecision in the eu is not something that has a strong foundation amongst the electorate . 
the democratic debate in europe today is based on the national parliamentary elections in each member state . 
to create a more democratic eu the national parliaments must be given greater influence in the work of the eu . 
. ( pt ) the debate and the resolution adopted by parliament give serious cause for concern as to what will be decided at the nice summit , specifically as regards the potential increase in restrictions on the sovereignty of small countries such as portugal , the strengthening of federalism and the militaristic path in security and defence policy , and the weak and clearly inadequate measures in the social sphere . 
i would like , in particular , to highlight a number of elements that i believe could hold inherent danger for the future stability of the union as well as raising questions as to the democratic legitimacy of the decision - making process . 
as far as the general extension of qualified majority voting is concerned , i do not believe that this is a helpful proposal as it would pre - empt the right of member states to take a decision at the appropriate time on whether a policy should be communitised . 
i firmly believe that any change from unanimity to qmv should be considered on a case - by - case basis . 
neither am i in favour of an automatic linking between qmv and codecision and once again believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should also be made on a case - by - case basis . 
i am already on record as being absolutely opposed to bringing the common agricultural policy into the codecision sphere and will not further elaborate on that issue at this point . 
in so far as the charter of fundamental rights is concerned , while i am in favour of promoting the rights referred to in this document , i do not support its incorporation into the eventual treaty of nice . 
an alternative solution such as eu accession to the european convention on human rights merits much closer examination . 
whatever is finally agreed at nice by the 15 member state governments may well have to be ratified by the irish people through a referendum . 
i can assure you that the current negotiations are being followed in my country , as i am sure they are in all of your countries . 
we must tread carefully and not run ahead of public opinion or of what our populations are ready for . 
-- ( fr ) the french presidency announced the birth of a political europe yet the nice summit will simply reinforce a europe of defence and a commercial union . 
the eu , within the framework of nato , will take part in imposing a new world order which has little sympathy for the fate of the palestinians and which is preparing to effectively endorse the liberalisation of rail transport and postal services . 
the accession of new countries is a pretext for emphasising a european structure which is satisfactory only to industrial groups . 
all the advocates of a liberal europe are enlarging is the scale of misery of peoples already crushed by poverty and not only that but , on this occasion , they are imposing a political agenda which involves placing on an official footing a core of rich countries which will control an expanded european market . 
by the same token , the eu is taking the initiative on the new liberal demands of the wto and capitalist globalisation . 
by amending article 133 of the treaty of amsterdam , europe would extend the qualified majority voting currently in force in the council in trade matters to other areas such as public services , intellectual property , health and education . 
finally , the adoption of a social agenda is a decoy . 
the charter of fundamental rights will not even be a new , short - lived label , but instead one more liberal standard threatening to be raised over europe . 
for our part , we shall be participating in the alternative social summit together with all those who refuse to turn the world into a commodity . 
. the votes of conservative meps today reflect our view that britain should be in a europe that does less and does it better , not run by a europe that does more , worse . 
there were two types of eu reform on offer to meps today . 
a conservative response to the white paper on commission reform would enable the eu to do less and to do it better . 
the resolution on the nice summit is the blueprint for the eu to do more , worse . 
the reforms proposed by malcolm harbour mep on the white paper are common sense reforms . 
this is the agenda labour and the lib dems support . 
. ( pt ) parliament has just voted for a resolution on the nice summit in which : 
. it does not deal clearly or in depth with any of the issues in which there were major divergences among the member states in the work leading up to the igc , leaving all the main amsterdam left - overs without any prospects even now . 
thus parliament waives its right to influence , shuts its mouth and remains silent for the sake of party , state and government loyalties , forgetting its obligations to the people . 
from this standpoint , the large states are blocked by the rest and cannot drag parliament into supporting their views , using it against us in the future architecture of the institutions . 
although we have not won , we have achieved a result in this resolution , which does not leave us defeated on the battlefield . 
sometimes silence is a victory.. . 
need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote ? 
democracy presupposes dialogue , which in turn presupposes a shared feeling of community , which is often linked to language . 
our debates within this chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges . 
compare them to the vivacity , energy and pertinence of the debates in national parliaments : the members of parliament in the palais bourbon , westminster , the cortes are able to compare ideas because they are expressed within the same cultural framework and in the same language . 
. ( fr ) one last time before the nice european council , the european parliament has had the opportunity to express its opinion on the major themes of the intergovernmental conference . 
the committee on constitutional affairs prepared a draft resolution outlining the expectations of the european parliament . 
while i may agree with the broad thrust of this resolution , " to make the european union more democratic , more effective and closer to its citizens " , i am nevertheless unable to take on board a certain number of proposals which seem to me to be rather vague . 
i therefore prefer to abstain . 
now , there are squabbles not only between the ' larger ' and the ' smaller ' but among the ' larger ' too . 
it would be a good idea for the european council to decide , from the outset , to base all its institutional decisions on the principle of double legitimacy , which has proved itself from the very inception of the community . 
. ( sv ) i welcome the aim to ease the enlargement process at the conference of the european council in nice . 
. ( sv ) we welcome and support the report , which touches on many important trends in the development of the common foreign and security policy . 
however , we cannot support the tasks performed by the high representative being transferred to the commission . 
the member states have responsibility for foreign diplomacy . 
my party , the socialist party of the netherlands , rejects any attempt on the part of the european union to imitate the superpower america . 
i cannot go along with the aims mr brok hopes to achieve via his report . 
. ( fr ) the ' other europe ' delegation of the union for a europe of nations group resolutely voted against the own - initiative report which was drawn up by the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy and presented by mr brok . 
this action plan , which deals with the structures , leaves out just one albeit decisive element , the definition and content , at an earlier stage , of a european foreign policy . 
the truth is that , far removed from the virtual visions which hold sway within this parliament , diplomatic realities are entirely different and the cfsp hardly exists . 
glaring proof of this has just been adduced , as if this were necessary , by the recognition of the republic of north korea by the united kingdom and germany , without waiting for a common position to be adopted . 
. there is much that the british conservative group can support in this report , in particular the emphasis on enlargement of the union . 
the criterion of success for this new form of cooperation must be that both the eu and nato are strengthened by it . 
-- ( da ) the danish social democrats in the european parliament have supported the report on setting up a common european security and defence policy . 
there are nonetheless a number of features of the report about which we have reservations . 
first of all , it is important to state that , because of its reservation in the military sphere , denmark cannot contribute forces to the common european rapid reaction force . 
secondly , we are sceptical about the ideas for establishing a proper european space policy , if the intention behind this is for europe to have a defence system such as that which the united states is in the process of establishing . 
from a research point of view and in relation to the monitoring of the environment , a common european space programme may nonetheless have some advantages . 
thirdly , there are a number of points in the report which leave one wishing that the european parliament had more influence in devising a common european security and defence policy . 
we think it is very important to state that formulating security and defence policy is an intergovernmental concern in which the european parliament neither can nor should be involved . 
. ( fr ) we have naturally voted against this report . 
under cover of establishing and developing a so - called european security and defence policy , it glaringly exposes the need for a military policy in the service of what it calls ' the foreign policy objectives of the european union ' , in other words , the interests of the imperialist powers and major capitalist groups which dominate europe and which dictate european union policy . 
we protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this chamber , with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups , from the extreme right to the greens and the socialists . 
the truth is that this policy is directed against ordinary people , like all those who , as we saw recently in the balkans , have to endure the imperialist military interventions by the european union and its allies . 
it is also , however , directed against the people of the european union who will , in any event , have to finance the new expenditure on armaments which the report advocates and who will not even have a guarantee that these military forces will not one day be turned against themselves for the sake of ' maintaining law and order ' . 
we can therefore only vote against this report . 
but this european army will primarily serve to stabilise the immediate periphery of the european union . 
the commercial annexation of the east and of north africa can but exacerbate social inequalities , which in turn will lead to social explosions , local armed conflicts and massive displacements of populations . 
it is positive that we are dealing with this by using mediation techniques , producing models for administrative solutions and delivering humanitarian aid to those who have felt constrained to move as a result of this conflict . 
it is no good trying to impose a solution from outside using military methods , because it does not tackle the root cause of the conflict or change public opinion . 
the fear that energy supplies will not be made available for the member states could never be a valid reason for unilateral intervention . 
. ( sv ) i have voted against the report . 
from among several points of which i am critical in the report i wish to mention the following examples : 
paragraph 49 : " calls at all events for any member state not wishing to take part in a task to be required , by reason of the mutual solidarity linking the member states , to make a financial contribution to be divided between the participating states " . 
in my opinion such a requirement is too far - reaching . 
brok report ( a5 - 0340 / 2000 ) and lalumière report ( a5 - 0339 / 2000 ) 
-- ( da ) we have voted against the brok and lalumière reports for a number of reasons . 
we do not consider that an arms build - up , with the resultant increased military expenditure , is the answer to the challenges faced by europe in 2001 and beyond . 
now , in the decade following the upheavals in the east , we think that , with these reports , ' the european peace project ' is sending an unhelpful signal to the applicant states . 
secondly , the reports set the stage for a split with the non - aligned countries which , it is proposed , would be involved through their financing of the common european security and defence policy . 
the talk about being ' united in diversity ' rings hollow , especially for the non - aligned member states , if only parts of the content of the reports are put into practice . 
the introduction of a new form of territorial defence , which would come under the aegis of a vice - president of the commission it has also been proposed , is a point that we cannot support either . 
a break of that kind with nato , only to see a new partitioning of europe , is far from the enigmatic words spoken following the fall of the berlin wall . 
what we definitely do not need is the development of further military structures . 
theorin report ( a5 - 0308 / 2000 ) 
i voted in favour of this measure , madam president , because it is only right that any attempt to bring peace to regions where internecine strife and civil conflicts rage should be supported by the pensioners ' party . 
i must , however , make one point to mrs theorin : among the numerous proposals she presented for women to be able to influence peace in war zones , she forgot to propose that the top echelons of armies should also be filled with women . 
-- ( de ) it is an acceptable idea , in principle , that the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities should produce an own - initiative report concerning the participation of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts . 
but the end product is actually tantamount to fraudulent misrepresentation , because very little of what has been set down in the nine and a half pages of this motion for a resolution actually relates to the subject of the report . 
we have 18 references to documents , declarations , conventions , resolutions of the un general assembly and security council and action plans which are hundreds of pages long , the scope of which is beyond the grasp of most of us . 
we have 19 recitals and 23 numbered paragraphs with 36 subparagraphs . 
a mere six of these paragraphs contain statements relating to the title of the report . 
the rest is packed with remarks about rape , the sexual misdemeanours of european soldiers on peacekeeping mission. the serb troops are not mentione. the positioning and lighting of latrines in refugee camps , demands relating to asylum and immigration policy , abortion , adoption , statistical analyses differentiated by sex , the creation of ministries for women 's affairs in the member states and much more besides . 
a teacher marking such a piece of work would write " does not answer the question " . 
i cannot support this kind of hotchpotch , which simply hijacks the subject to use it as a vehicle for ramming ideological demands on the aforementioned topics down our throats . 
let me pre - empt any misinterpretation of my vote as an expression of opposition to women 's participation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts . 
i am not opposed to i. on the contrary ! 
. i support this report from my colleague maj - britt theorin . 
as she points out , sexual violence and mass rapes of women are used systematically during conflicts as weapons of war . 
i back her calls to the member states to take all necessary steps to amend article 75 of the fourth geneva protocol to define rape , forced impregnation and sexual slavery as war crimes ; i also support her call for the ratification of the treaty of rome on the international criminal court . 
some provision. like punishing rapists , making camps physically safe for women , and making sure women in stressful situations get fair portions of food and medical resources - are good . 
but the language of the document goes even further . 
sadly , there is clearly an aim at overriding national abortion laws or even punishing or suppressing faith traditions opposing abortion . 
this contravenes the constitution of my country of ireland , and i have no doubt the legislative position of other countries which seek to diminish rather than promote the practice of abortion . 
whilst i fully recognise and support the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution , i must sadly vote against this rather confused report . 
smet report ( a5 - 0301 / 2000 ) 
. ( fr ) the only positive aspects of this report are that it calls for a ' european definition of domestic work ' and a ' clear limitation of the maximum number of hours to be worked ' . 
but the needs of this category of employers are only brought up in order to call for the introduction of measures to make ' domestic services tax - deductible ' and to adjust ' prices and costs to take account of individuals ' financial resources ' . 
if parliament votes in favour of this clause , it will above all enable rich families to subsidise their expenditure on domestic services by money squeezed out of the community . 
i would like to add an extra touch of cynicism : the explanatory statement makes domestic workers responsible for the fact that their employers employ them illegally . 
as a result , although we are not voting against this report on account of the few basic rights which it does express , we will not be voting in favour of it either . 
. ( sv ) we are voting against this report that deals with so - called domestic help . 
the introduction of models of this type , sometimes referred to as the " new labour market " , in countries such as belgium and denmark clearly shows a preservation of a lower servant class consisting primarily of immigrant women , but also of men and the long - term unemployed . 
to tax - subsidise such a labour market is in our opinion downright offensive . 
tax resources should be used in another way , for example so that people can improve themselves and be given choices in life . 
problems taken up in the report can be solved with a humane asylum and refugee policy , by organising work to take into consideration a balance between work and personal life as well as by taking responsibility for people with special needs in a way which shows solidarity and social responsibility . 
many tens of thousands of women in the european union who provide domestic help in the informal sector of the economy would no doubt be delighted that we are dealing with the regulation of such activity , if only they knew . 
that , of course , almost sounds like a perfect world when i read all the proposals for possible exceptional arrangements that are listed in this report . 
i see no reason , for example , why the working conditions of domestic staff should be in any way untypical . 
too many young people are at risk of their first contact with the labour market being a job in the black economy . 
it is highly unfortunate that unreasonable tax rules are forcing people into the black economy in this way . 
we therefore agree with the rapporteur that it is important for the differences between the costs of ' black ' and ' white ' labour to be reduced and feel that the member states should introduce a tax reduction on domestic services . 
this will allow the people who carry out domestic services to be covered by insurance , pension schemes , sick pay and security . 
however , we are against the introduction of a legal framework containing detailed rules at european level for domestic help . 
these matters should be dealt with at national , regional or local level , and consequently we are voting against the report . 
mrs smet is right to draw attention to the vulnerable position of domestic helpers in the black economy . 
she is calling for a european definition of " domestic work " to be drafted and for member states to draw up and regularly update statistics on undeclared work . 
she wants this type of work to be recognised as an occupation in its own right and is calling for european rules to be established on the rights of these worker. at present the situation varies from country to country . 
the needs of domestic workers should be considered when employment legislation is being drafted . 
the need for all member states to introduce the principle of declaring all employment relationships is stressed and both employers and employees should be made aware of their rights under their employment relationship . 
finally , she wants member states to link the issuing of visas for domestic employees working for diplomats to be linked to a guaranteed minimum level of working conditions . 
this report merits careful consideration . 
the employee has little or no protection and in many cases is largely dependent on the discretion of the employer . 
the very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries , having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves . 
it is an occupational group that is often forgotten in a world still heavily dominated by men . 
everyone is aware that the situation is open to abuse , but many people are inclined to seriously underestimate the scale of this abuse and the impact on those concerned . 
the talks held with interested organisations and the itemisation of the problems that exist remind me of investigative reports on the position of workers over a century ago . 
although my group considers the report to be too limited and the conclusions too modest , they will help us to start moving in the right direction . 
they have given their pension contributions to the various national governments , which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians . 
the commission reform will be judged on actual evidence , hence the need for regular follow - up reports , which the european commission will present throughout the programme , and the importance of the overall report , which is expected in december 2002 . 
it is , moreover , common knowledge that certain nationalities are manifestly over - represented in the junior grades of categories c and d , for the undisclosed budgetary reason that the staff concerned would not benefit from the 16 % expatriation allowance ! 
the fact is that community policies are reflected in moral and financial commitments to our citizens and third - country nationals . 
it is therefore necessary to ensure that these commitments are respected much more closely than they have been in the past . 
as far as human resources are concerned , the quality of employees and greater transparency in staffing policy in general must become the strong points of the new administrative reform . 
the union for a europe of nations group welcomes in principle the response represented by the commission white paper to the appeal made by the european parliament inviting it to carry out far - reaching reform of its human resources policy . 
the union for a europe of nations group , however , forcefully recalls that , as regards staff recruitment , the commission reform must take account of the diversity of opinions and beliefs which are expressed in our countries regarding europe , its past and its future . 
the citizens of our respective countries would not understand if this were not the case . 
by the same token , lack of transparency and nepotism must be eradicated from recruitment , especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts . 
the union for a europe of nations group does not at this stage wish to express any opposition to the early retirement of hundreds of officers from the commission services provided , however , that the statutory provisions are respected , that the early retirement measures do not hinder the priorities of the reform , that these retirements have a neutral impact on the budget , that they are implemented in the interest of the service and under volunteer termination of service and do not give rise to a political settling of scores . 
lamassoure report ( a5 - 0328 / 2000 ) 
i have voted in favour of the lamassoure report , which concerns itself most of all with the institutional aspects of commission reform . 
during this explanation of vote , i must emphasise the fact that parliament does not , unfortunately , have all the powers it should have . 
a change i have never heard propose. yet one which i consider useful , important and not difficult to implemen. is that the initiative in lawmaking should be reserved for parliament and not shared with the commission . 
the commission should execute : it should be the executive power of the european union ; parliament should be the legislative power . 
we did not vote in favour because we feel that all too often the development cooperation within the commission is still regarded as a stopgap measure . 
that concludes the voting . 
madam president , at the nice european council , there have been two types of resolution which relate to issues which we have dealt with in parliament , such as , for example , the status of the european limited company , the social agenda , maritime safety and bse . 
however , at this time , neither my group nor any other has any knowledge of the final texts decided on by the intergovernmental conference and , bearing in mind that we cannot pass judgment on such sensitive issues , we believe that we should not table a resolution on the results of the conference unless we want to express a positive or negative initial reaction , and we therefore believe it is not appropriate . 
furthermore , in order to produce a short resolution we must understand the issues very well . 
madam president , there has been mention of what the task of the committee on constitutional affairs may be . 
i must point out that the committee is to meet tomorrow afternoon , firstly to try to really get to grips with what the conclusions of the intergovernmental conference were . 
we shall have the chance to address the representative of the commission in order to obtain information on the draft text of the treaty , which we do not have as yet . 
madam president , we voted on 4 december . 
for this reason , i think that it would be wise to extend the deadlin. if need b. and to debate the peijs report in january . 
does anyone wish to speak against this request for a postponement ? 
if not , i will put it to the vote . 
( parliament approved the request ) 
madam president , i should like this put off until january 2001, if possible , as commissioner fischler is unable to be here because of fisheries meetings . 
it is very important that he is present for this report because he is very interested in it and we are very much in the hands of the commission for its success . 
madam president , while enlargement was being discussed at the nice summit , the french government was practising a kind of contraction , stopping 1200 young italians at ventimiglia as they were on their way to take part in a union demonstration . 
that was an infringement of the freedom of movement as laid down in the schengen agreement , and i would be grateful if you would seek an explanation from the french government . 
i think a very unusual interpretation of the schengen agreement was applied in that case , actually , and , no doubt , if it had been a group of bankers or a train carrying meat - and - bone meal , the french government would have been far more tolerant . 
thank you , mr krivine . 
thank you , mr korakas . 
by merging three pre - existing directives , we are obviously staying strictly within the boundaries of improving the operation of the internal market without , however , renouncing forging ahead with a harm - reduction strategy and curbing a true scourge : smoking , which is costly in both social and economic terms . 
during this second reading , we have had two main concerns : firstly , political reconciliation of the aim of protecting health with the nevertheless valid point of view of production and employment . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , 80 fatalities in europe from new variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease , and europe , its council of ministers , the commission and parliament decide to ban meat - and - bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months ' old from the food chain without prior testing . 
so , once again , i shall deal with the substance and not the form . 
the fact is that the court of justice has just repealed the 1998 directive banning advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products . 
the court held that a total ban on tobacco advertising cannot be justified in the name of the proper functioning of the internal market . 
now , in contempt of the treaties , believing it is entrusted with a mission of salvation , our parliament marches on , head down , to push this text through , come what may . 
that attitude perfectly sums up the defects of our european institutions , always ready to go to any lengths to achieve the ideological goals they have set themselves . 
but there are rules that have to be respected and we have to remember that . 
if tobacco had to be admitted to the european market as a new product , it would certainly be rejected for health reasons . 
on a final note , i must sadly point out again that the european tobacco policy is still inconsistent . 
tobacco consumption is discouraged on the one hand , yet on the other , in excess of eur 1 billion is spent on tobacco subsidies annually . 
i would like to take this opportunity to again express my wish that this will change some day . 
mr president , i rise in defence of the workers in the industry . 
we have a large tobacco industry in northern ireland , gallaher 's ltd. if this directive is adopted , at least 300 jobs will be lost . 
i have studied carefully what the commissioner said to my colleague mr hume : " no massive job losses in this sector . 
it must be said that the manufacturers will sell not one cigarette fewer than they do now , because they will transfer their business outside the european union . 
gallaher 's will transfer its business to its russian factory and the ceilings will be ignored , but we will have exported 300 jobs . 
the job losses in gallaher 's will affect workers about 47 years old on average . 
in northern ireland , if you lose your job at 47 there is not much chance of getting another job . 
mr president , these doubts , these justifiable doubts , which have nothing to do with any shady or mysterious friendship with some company or other , are the reason for the vote of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and i remember that it was 18 votes to 9 . 
although i was not present , my vote , of course , supported the committee . 
mr president , mrs palacio vallelersundi has just put the commissioner in the dock and , in this case , while we are talking about interinstitutional balance , all the commission has done is to have tabled a proposal for a directive . 
it is parliament and the council who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine , amongst other things , a suitable legal basis for it . 
the court of justice is therefore trying to prevent any contrivance by means of which this subterfuge could be employed . 
however , in this case , this situation does not apply because the proposal for a directive , like the previous directives already in force , intends , in fact , to remove existing barriers to the functioning of the internal market . 
therefore , their correct legal basis is the former article 100a or the current article 95 . 
mr president , it is regrettable that despite all the efforts made by rapporteur maaten , we must conclude that no one is really happy with the developments that now characterise this report . 
i would like to make three brief comments . 
my first comment concerns the legal basis . 
the court has had a judicial review carried out and states quite explicitly that article 95 can be the legal basis in some cases , provided certain conditions are met , but also states that article 95 will not be sufficient in certain cases , for example article 133 would need to be added where the export ban is concerned . 
in view of the lack of motivation , i therefore support the amendment tabled by mrs palacio vallelersundi , which calls for us to reject the common position and ask the commission to submit a new proposal . 
mr president , if this proposal actually becomes law at second reading , this will lead to companies ' freedom being curtailed somewhat , and to a slight improvement in the protection of public health . 
my group would rather the proposal had taken an all - encompassing approach . 
taking public health as the starting point , this would entail a complete ban on advertising and sponsorship and reducing to a minimum the number of young people who take up smoking . 
we would also need to look at what impact a reduction in the production and consumption of tobacco would have in terms of alternative employment for tobacco farmers and tobacco industry workers , how to put an end to the current eu subsidy regime for tobacco cultivation , and what we need to do to oppose international trade in this unwholesome product . 
research has shown that the greater the size of the public health warning on cigarette packets , the greater the reduction in the level of cigarette smoking . 
the results of the research on that matter are so clear that it would be wrong for us , as european union legislators , not to follow such advice . 
we need to send out a strong message about smoking to the 370 million consumers of the european union and we are going to give our children and smokers all the necessary public warnings about the health dangers of cigarette smoking . 
in conclusion , since the treaty of amsterdam the european parliament has the power of coordination over environmental and consumer protection matters , and it will , of course , work closely with the council and the commission in this regard . 
we regard this procedure as an important legislative weapon of parliament 's arsenal and we intend to use it . 
it is a classic symptom of political correctness gone mad . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i should like to correct a misapprehension : the committee on legal affairs and the internal market rejected the directive as a whole as early as the first reading , although it is true that parliament did not go along with it . 
the only laudable exception is parliament 's legal service . 
unfortunately , time does not allow me to go into detail here ; that is quite impossible . 
i can only call on colleagues to go along with the recommendation of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
this very issue of delimiting competences was addressed in nice . 
but if whenever a material majority is found on a specific issue in the three bodie. the commission , the council of ministers and parliamen. this majority is also observed , then we can do without this ceremony and it would suggest that what really matters are institutional safeguards . 
i believe that reducing the limit values for the tar content and reducing some of the limits for how much nicotine and carbon monoxide cigarettes may contain will have an extremely significant effect on health in europe . 
it is important to insist that the commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest . 
the secrecy on the part of industry surrounding additives which we have witnessed so far should naturally be brought to an end. i also consider it important that , independently of this common list , a ban is imposed on the use of ammonia and other similar compounds used for the express purpose of making cigarettes more addictive , to increase dependence on cigarettes . 
this is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way . 
finally i would like to make a single comment concerning the matter of exports . 
i simply do not understand why a majority here in parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the member states ' own government. the governments which , however , also represent the many industries referred to . 
like mrs thyssen , i feel that it is absolutely unethical for us to sell cigarettes outside the area of europe which , for health reasons , we consider to be unsuitable for use by citizens in our own area . 
it simply cannot be ethically justifiable to act in this way , and i therefore hope that on this point we arrive at the responsible line which i believe the council and the commission have proposed . 
mr president , i think that we need to make the requirements for the manufacture and sale of tobacco tougher and that to do so in a harmonised fashion , by means of a directive which must be respected by all the member states , could strengthen the objective of preventing consumers from taking up smoking and of protecting them from this habit . 
nevertheless , i truly consider it to be unacceptable to interpret the differences in criteria with regard to the content of the proposal for a directive in terms of a supposed confrontation between the powerful interests of the tobacco lobbies and the common interest of protecting consumers . 
to accept this would be to misrepresent the legitimate arguments of a good number of members of the european parliament who see , in the need to respect the legal aspects , a guarantee of the future viability of our own legislative acts . 
public opinion cannot and must not be fed solely by political gestures which are not solidly based in the reality of what is possible within the competences conferred on us by the treaties . 
mr president , smoking is the tragedy of our tim. the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the european union . 
more than half a million people die needlessly each year in the european union and the number is set to grow if we do not act now . 
that is why this directive is so important : bigger , bolder , clearer health warnings , a ban on misleading descriptions such as ' light ' , ' ultra ' and ' mild ' , a maximum tar content for products used in the eu as well as for exports , and , for the first time , a disclosure of ingredients . 
if we do not act now , worldwide deaths are estimated at one billion this century . 
i predict that this directive , too , will fall before the european court of justice , and parliament and the commission will make a fool of themselves just as they did the first time , if we are not prepared to examine the legal aspects . 
commissioner , you are a guardian of the treaties and not someone who can overstep your competences here on your own initiative . 
if you enlist article 133 for the export ban then the conclusion is obvious that it is not part of a common commercial policy to dictate to third countries what they should import . 
mr president , tobacco wrecks lives . 
to the shame of this european union , we require our taxpayers to subsidise the growing of the wretched stuff to the tune of over eur 1 billion a year . 
at the same time , we jeopardise sensible measures to deter smoking , especially among young people , because we try to put the whole world within our single market . 
if we insist on telling other countries what health standards they should set by extending our sensible proposals for the domestic market to exports , we shall put all mr maaten 's good work at risk . 
because , as sure as export night follows advertising day , there will be another challenge in the courts , and not just the export provision but the whole directive with it will be thrown out . 
i should like the commissioner to clarify whether the removal of the exemption for exports applies just to the tar and nicotine levels , as was the impression given in committee , or to all the proposals in the directive . 
we need to know because thousands of jobs are at stake in darlington , nottingham , southampton and belfast . 
those jobs could be destroyed very quickly by our misunderstanding and our vote . 
i want to see sensible measures go through and not lost . 
there was also a readiness to compromise within the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy . 
i have in mind mrs martens and mr sacconi and our cooperation with them . 
i should also like to stress the efforts made by the rapporteur , mr maaten , to advance with this file in a balanced and conscientious way . 
in fact , the main job reductions in this industry are due to increased investment in automation , as the firms themselves have declared . 
the commission would nevertheless see an argument for an extended transitional period for the application of the rules for exported products , in order to allow more time for manufacturing formulae to be changed and new marketing approaches to be undertaken . 
mr bowis asked whether the exemption would apply . 
the exemption would apply to article 3, as i understand the amendment , i.e. tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide levels . 
as regards the question of descriptors , i would stress that the effect of the use of certain terms such as ' light ' , ' low - tar ' and ' mild ' can be very misleading . 
people change from one type of cigarette to another under the false assumption that the ' light ' cigarette is safer for their health . 
this is also a factor in why people continue to smoke instead of trying to stop . 
therefore , the need to regulate in the interests of consumers is clear . 
indeed , in the negotiations presently under way for a world health organisation framework convention on public health , the same provisions are currently proposed . 
for instance , paragraph 88 of the judgment further states : " furthermore , provided that the conditions for recourse to article 100a [ that is now 95 ] and 66 as a legal basis are fulfilled , the community legislature cannot be prevented from relying on that legal basis on the ground that public health protection is a decisive factor in the choices to be made . 
on the contrary , the third paragraph of article 129 ( 1 ) provides that health requirements are to form a constituent part of the community 's other policies , and article 100a ( 3 ) expressly requires that , in the process of harmonisation , a high level of human health protection is to be ensured " . 
given the general nature of the directive , we cannot sever one from the other and , therefore , we have to strike it all down . 
there is a clear signpost here as to how we can move forward on these issues . 
in answer to the question on exports that mr bowis asked me earlier , it is quite clear that , in the unlikely event that the aspect of the directive that refers to exports is challenged and if the view of the cour. which i do not predic. is that it is not supported by the legal basis , it is clearly severable from the directive . 
therefore , even in those circumstances , the directive would survive . 
to do so before we have the necessary data would be speculative and premature . 
we need to have sufficient time to analyse this information and to consult expert opinion . 
in addition , the commission wishes to preserve its right of initiative under the treaty in this respect . 
on the size of the warning labels , i am sure that a satisfactory compromise can be achieved , based perhaps on the commission 's amended proposal of june , which already went towards the amendments made at first reading . 
the use of coloured photos to accompany texts is perhaps premature and not fully evaluated at this stage . 
the commission would prefer to examine the available data and report back in due course . 
the creation of a maximum - sized warning label for some large packs would be a proportionate solution . 
mr davies said in relation to the coloured photographs that member states might be given permission to have this form of advertising on the packet . 
i do not agree with that view for two reasons : firstly , this would run counter to the concept of harmonisation , which is the justification for using article 95 as the basis ; secondly , even if member states wanted to advertise in this way , it does not require any sanction or authorisation by legislation at eu level to do so . 
the issue of vending machines falls outside the scope of this text but the commission would be willing to examine it in another context to see what approaches would be possible . 
this is linked to the question of access to products , in particular where machines are situated in unsupervised areas . 
on the amendment dealing with gmos , the commission considers that this would be better dealt with as an additional recital rather than mentioning it in an article by itself . 
on laboratory tests , the amendment dealing with approval of tests is superfluous as another article provides for circulation of goods that are in accordance with the provisions of the directive . 
we also need to make provision for results of tests to be controlled where necessary . 
most member states accept and want summer time , and thus this report is not at all controversial . 
the advantage of making summer time a permanent arrangement would be to make planning easier . 
particular sectors involved in this , for example , it and computers , transport , communications , air and rail , have said to us and to the commission that they would find it very helpful to know that there will be summer time every year , that it will be permanent , so they can make forward - planning arrangements . 
there is also a good argument in terms of the single market , where again similar planning considerations apply . 
in terms of the substance of the report , what is being suggested is that the current arrangements , with summer time starting on the last sunday in march and ending on the last sunday in october , remain in place and are made permanent arrangements . 
however , amendments have been put forward calling for a review and for a report to be produced at the end of five years . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again i see that a far - reaching debate is raging about the pros and cons of summer time . 
it is also obvious that there has to be agreement across the eu on when the clocks are changed because anything els. as has already been sai. would lead to hopeless confusion . 
i also think that the public would rightly question the point or otherwise of much eu legislation . 
from the point of view of farmer. this has also already been sai. repeatedly switching between summer and winter time is not exactly ideal for our farms , either as far as the animals are concerned or the actual work on the farm . 
nevertheless , i will say quite openly that there are more advantages than disadvantages in favour of changing the clocks and in favour of keeping the summer time arrangements as they currently stand . 
we should leave the arrangements as they are and in my opinion prolong them indefinitely . 
consequently , i can say on behalf of my group that we do not wish to accept any amendments . 
i have said this because i and my group are convinced that europe has more serious problems and tasks to deal with . 
summer time is not the problem for our common european house . 
madam president , since the 1970s various member states have applied the practice of switching to summer time . 
the dates for starting and ending summer time were harmonised , finally , a few years ago so that they have been the same in all the member states of the eu since 1996 . 
we have become used to the practice , as the previous speaker just said . 
the proposal that has now been made is , in the opinion of our group , a good one , and our group supports it , and no more amendments to it are needed . 
the main issue here is that summer time is applied in all member states and that the date it starts and the date it ends remain uniform throughout the eu . 
it is to be welcomed that the proposal states that matters connected with time zones and summer time provisions should be matters for member states to decide . 
the commission is simply required to report on the impact of the directive after five years . 
it is absolutely essential to the smooth functioning of european industry , particularly in the fields of transport , communication , tourism and it , that it have a stable and long - term framework in which to plan . 
countless statements from industrial sectors show that this long - term stability of summer time dates is urgently necessary for the harmonious functioning of the internal market . 
for economic and social reasons it is simply imperative that the summer time arrangements are clear , comprehensible and long - term , so that people can plan ahead and do not need to worry that one day this policy will suddenly be reversed . 
the amendments which have been tabled by parliament and the rapporteur are therefore , in my opinion , unhelpful , because they tend to create uncertainty rather than increase confidence . 
a one - off review by the commission in five years ' time will suffice . 
i certainly believe that we could get along without it , although i am not prepared to give up the warm summer weather . 
but that is something politicians fortunately cannot make decisions about . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are discussing today is intended to extend the existing arrangements concerning the dates and times when the summer time period begins and ends , that is , on the last sunday in march and the last sunday in october at 1 o ' clock in the morning greenwich mean time . 
allow me , first of all , to congratulate your rapporteur , mrs honeyball , for her excellent work and the report she has produced . 
you will have noted that , compared with the earlier directives the arrangements proposed are of indefinite duration . 
the study ordered by the commission in 1999, in accordance with the commitment it gave to the council and european parliament when the eighth directive was adopted , concludes that the arrangements are widely accepted both by the public and by the various sectors of activity . 
however , it has become apparent that adopting the arrangements for a comparatively short period could cause difficulties for certain sectors . 
for example , the transport sector in particular , but also other sectors of industry , requires stable , long - term planning on account of technical requirements connected with the preparation of transport timetables . 
there are also the requirements of manufacturers of computers or electronic tachographs and producers of calendars and diaries . 
last but not least , the time - consuming and expensive repetition of legislative procedures at fairly close intervals at both community and national level should be avoided . 
while these are all reasons militating in favour of adopting open - ended arrangements , as a precaution the commission has made provision for drawing up , no later than five years after the first year of application of the directive , a report based on information supplied by each member state . 
on this point i am pleased to note that the commission 's proposal has been favourably received by the european parliament . 
as regards the amendments tabled , the commission can agree to amendments nos 3 and 4 since they aim at making the system more transparent and emphasise the precautionary principle . 
as regards amendment no 1, the commission cannot accept the part of the amendment which obliges it to make a periodic report every five years , nor the reference to the enlargement process . 
it can agree to make appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report of 2007 referred to in article 5 . 
concerning amendment no 2 to recital 6a , the commission cannot accept it for two reasons : on the one hand the scope of the investigations should not be restricted to a few requirements , and on the other hand , the proposed amendment to recital 6a does not relate to a specific article of the directive . 
secondly , consent must be informed , which means , in particular , that the person taking part must have been informed of the conditions under which the trial is to be conducted , the potential risks that he runs and his unrestricted right to withdraw from the trial at any time . 
finall. and i think this point is fundamenta. we must ensure that the greatest possible protection is guaranteed to those who are not in a position to give their consent : the weakest , children and legally incapacitated adults . 
they must be able to expect direct benefit from the clinical trial . 
besides , we know that empirically dividing the adult dose to treat children has already led to tragedy in the past . 
then there is the opposite extreme , children not treated because , although the specific medicine to cure them exists , it has not been tested for them . 
i am particularly thinking of cancer research , but there are many others . 
madam president , i am pleased that so many colleagues have emphasised how important it is to u. and this is , i believe , the central point in this debat. to protect particularly vulnerable groups of people , namely children and those who are unable to give informed consent , and to ensure that no research is carried out which is useful to others unless it is also of direct benefit to them . 
it was only , in my view , this amendment , tabled by us , that made this important debate possible . 
i should like to stress this once more : i am glad that the rapporteur has given ground on this point because it has allowed us to reach what i believe is a very good compromise . 
this compromise , which of course can be further improved upon by each member state , constitutes a minimum standard , to ensure that we do not have a kind of ethical dumping in the european union and to avoid a situation where it is possible to carry out research on those unable to give informed consent in one member state and not in others . 
i am also pleased , however , that we have succeeded in clamping down on germ - line gene therapy . 
it must be quite clear that clinical research which seeks to introduce germ - line manipulation by the back door must not be possible , because this would be a violation of human dignity . 
that is why i believe that this compromise is very good , particularly when you consider that the member states are able to introduce even stricter rules . 
through this compromise we are making it clear that there must be no ethical dumping at european level and that there must be no research which is of benefit to outsiders on those unable to give informed consent . 
finally , i should like to cordially request that the council re - examine our amendment on placebos . 
here , as you know , we have proposed that research involving placebos should only take place if it can be proved that there is no other way of monitoring effectiveness , because we wish to avoid research taking place if there is no direct benefit , but at the same time we wish to enable research to happen . 
that is why we made this proposal , and i should like to ask the french presidency to kindly make a note to answer this question . 
madam president , health is the most precious of gifts and everything must be done to maintain and restore it . 
that is why medical science should be given every possible means of properly protecting individual and public health . 
unfortunately , although the right measures are taken , they are unable to prevent new risks and diseases from emerging which the drugs available are unable to treat , and the medical community is obliged to find modern , more effective ways of meeting these challenges . 
madam president , i should like to start by saying that i am most dissatisfied with the commission for its unwarranted delay in submitting the proposal to extend the six public health action plans to parliament . 
they include the action plan to combat cancer , the programme of action for the prevention of aids , the programme of action for the prevention of drug dependence and the action plan to promote health and , if they are suspended , it will mean an end to the projects and the work being carried out by the networks which have been set up . 
the codecision procedure to implement the new public health action plans for 2001 - 2006 cannot be completed by 12 december 2000, when 4 out of the 6 programmes expire , which is why we urgently need to agree to their being extended , initially by one year and then by a second year if the new action programme has not yet entered into force . 
this being the case , i agree with the rapporteur 's proposal to speed up the procedures and avoid two readings by reaching an agreement with the council and the commission on the budget lines in question . 
i trust that we shall not have to deal again with this sort of delay in such vital areas as public health in the future . 
madam president , may i start by pointing out that the programmes which it is proposed to extend , four programmes for two years ' training and two programmes for one year 's training , are directly related to the new health programme which is currently being discussed in the committee on the environment . 
unfortunately , the new programme , which will run from 2001 to 2006, is still not ready and is not expected to enter into force for some time . 
consequently , the request for an extension to the previous programme. important programmes on cancer , aids , diseases such as pollution - related diseases or the monitoring of infectious diseases , i.e. programmes which are of tremendous significance to public health in genera. was a logical step . 
if they are not extended , we shall have a huge gap in public health issues and programmes . 
we must not forget that the essence of the acquis communautaire from these programmes needs to be passed on to the new health programmes currently being drawn up and it is therefore only right that we extend them . 
what we have agreed with the council and the commission and , of course , with parliament 's committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , so as to avoid a second reading and allow these programmes to continue without a break , thereby avoiding any gaps , is to extend the four programmes by two years , as the commission has requested ; however , the money will only be released a year at a time , so that if the new health programme is approved and enters into force in the meantime , there will be no need for an extension and the money can be used for the second year . 
if , of course , the new programme has not yet begun , which i do not believe will be the case , then we shall , of course , carry on and use the money for the second year . 
so that is what we have agreed ; we have agreed that the two programmes which expire in december 2001 will be extended for one year and we have also agreed on the amount , which is the same , in fact it is slightly less than the amount which the european commission originally requested . 
so we have , i think , proceeded very quickly and with excellent cooperation . 
i would even go so far as to say that we may well have inaugurated a new modus operandi for codecision issues . 
instead of waiting for conciliation , which takes a very long time , we have , to all intents and purposes , dealt with the conciliation in advance , a method which i would recommend to the european commission , the council and the parliamentary committees . 
what a good idea to be able to prepare the way , to proceed as far down the line as possible , to be so close that , even if we need a second reading , we are already within a hair 's breadth of a decision . 
i trust that we shall proceed in the same manner and will use the same method for the new health programme , so that we really can make headway on these issues , and that the european integration which we talk of , constantly telling ourselves that it is not something abstract , is not the sort of integration which only applies to external relations and defence issues . 
it is a series of convergences . 
it is impossible to conceive of a unified european union without convergence in the health sector and in the education and other sectors . 
the prevention of drug dependence programmes must also be focused not only on black spots , but across many other areas within the european union . 
international organisations such as europol have estimated that the importation of drugs into the union is actually increasing . 
as i see it though , efforts have been made recently to raise the profile of public health as a relevant and fundamental topic for europe , although this development is at odds with the treaty . 
i am also perturbed by the fact that the various healthcare systems of the european union will come up for discussion in new proposals soon to be on the agenda . 
it is possible that national systems will be called into question in the process , or even adversely affected in the future , which i think would be an undesirable development . 
to summarise , madam president , i must say the developments in the public health sector in the european union go too far for my liking . 
public health is national policy and should stay that way . 
i therefore do not support public health programmes that can be used as a stepping stone to erode national policy , when the programmes currently on the table scarcely provide anything over and above what the member states themselves can offer . 
i thank parliament , particularly the members of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and , above all , the rapporteur , mr trakatellis , for the great efforts made to ensure that this proposal can be adopted in one reading and in record time . 
within the framework of the individual programme decisions , their work programmes will be adapted to these needs . 
as far as the text in front of you is concerned , i now hope that once it is voted by parliament the decision will be adopted by the health council on 14 december . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will be taken on wednesday at 11.30 a.m . 
standing of victims in criminal procedure 
the next item is the debate on the report ( a5 - 0355 / 2000 ) by mrs cerdeira morterero , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the initiative of the portuguese republic with a view to adopting a council framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal procedure [ 9650 / 200 . 
it is , without doubt , a new element in the european judicial system , in which , for the first time , victims have their own recognised judicial status and not , as has been the case until now , one which is derived from the crime . 
in many cases , the victim is the object of a crime in the territory of a member state other than their usual state of residence , which means that their problems and suffering are exacerbated and complicated by a whole range of circumstances which are negative , but common and constant , in the treatment of victims : a lack of communication owing to ignorance of the language , a lack of information , loneliness , a lack of protection in certain areas in which each state has preserved its own legal system . 
therefore , and with the aim of being able to respond adequately to the needs of this type of victim , international standards have also been created which take account of the defence of victims ' rights and interests . 
i wish to highlight just two aspects of this initiative at the moment : european convention no 116 of the council of europe of 24 november 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crimes . 
i would like to highlight that , despite its importance and the fact that it is a mandatory point of reference in europe , the convention has still not been ratified , as of 18 september 2000, by the following member states of the european union : austria , belgium , greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain . 
another international initiative is the united nations declaration of basic principles of justice for victims of crime and abuse of power adopted by general assembly resolution 40 / 34 on 29 november 1985 . 
ladies and gentlemen , because of what i have said previously , and in accordance with the provisions of article 2 ( 4 ) of the european union treaty , which lays down that one of the objectives of the union is to maintain and develop the union as an area of freedom , security and justice in which the free movement of persons is guaranteed , we must ensure that this area of freedom , security and justice guarantees genuine access to justice so that the european public can benefit from suitable legal protection in any part of the union . 
for this reason , the citizens ' europe will not make sense unless we first adopt , amongst others , the necessary measures to improve and also take account of the rights of victims of crime , aimed in a global sense at safeguarding all their rights and interests , on the one hand , and , from a community point of view , at harmonising the legislation of the 15 member states on the other . 
everybody , including the nationals of third countries who have been victims of a crime in any state of the european union , must receive the same minimum level of treatment . 
the european union cannot accept the idea that people might receive different treatment depending on the state in which they have been a victim of crime or on their nationality . 
the first question was to what extent there actually was a legal basis for this proposal . 
as rapporteur , i took the view that the undertaking proposed to us here was admittedly a laudable one , but that , unfortunately , it was simply the case that within the european union and also in relation to the member states there were relatively clear rules about who had which competences . 
as rapporteur , my opinion is that issues relating to organising criminal prosecution and procedural criminal law do not fall within the competence of the treaty on european union and that these matters should be dealt with by the member states . 
unfortunately , the committee did not go along with my proposal in this specific case , but , as rapporteur , i should nevertheless like to make this opinion known . 
the second aspect which played a certain part was the issue of evidence recorded on video . 
you may remember the debate on the so - called di pietro report , which was held here in this house some time ago . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the report before us today is the result of an initiative by the portuguese presidency and is part of a range of measures designed to promote the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice , in order to provide a useful response to the everyday concerns of the european public . 
often , when we address issues of justice , we devote too much time to the penal system , to prisons , to crime - fighting forces , to criminal codes and even to the claims of those in the legal profession . 
it may be that we have devoted too little time to the victims , who are often the weakest members of society . 
it is also in the interests of the victim for the case to be brought to a swift conclusion , since slow proceedings can lead to the person feeling an ever worse sense of victimisation a second time round . 
just in recent months two cases have been referred to me . 
victims of crime must know their rights and what opportunities they actually have for receiving help . 
most member states provide some form of initial help for victims . 
sometimes travellers need additional support and perhaps more support than the local population . 
the question of the situation of victims of criminal offences in europe was first mentioned in the vienna action plan and included in the conclusions of the european council of tampere . 
further , it was the subject of a communication from the commission on 14 july 1999 . 
part of the proposals made in this communication to improve the standards and the assumption of responsibility for victims were included in the draft framework decision presented by the portuguese presidency and which is submitted to you today . 
i acknowledge the work carried out on this text by mrs cerdeira morterero , your rapporteur . 
it was the subject of difficult discussions in the council . 
as you noted , the draft framework decision contains three different types of measures : firstly , it enacts minimum rules with regard to the victim 's rights ; secondly , it enacts specific rules aiming to take into account the individual situation of those people who are victims of an offence in a member state other than their state of origin and , thirdly , it encourages the states to develop measures for victim support . 
one can be particularly pleased with certain provisions , for example the possibility for victims to lodge a complaint at the place of their residence when they are not in a position to do so in the state where the offence took place . 
the commission does not have any objection to the majority of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur . 
however , i would like to draw your attention to three points . 
several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , foreseeing the right of victims to communicate in one of these languages . 
in other cases , it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the union which is not their own . 
the commission wishes to continue the feasibility study for such a project . 
it already works to support the networking at european level of the national services for victim support in order to ensure appropriate care of victims , particularly if they do not reside where the offence took place . 
the idea of a ' green number ' will be examined within this context . 
at this stage , it is perhaps preferable to bring about a working relationship with the services for victim support , rather than putting in a text the principle of a ' green number ' , which would be likely to have no future . 
mr posselt , we will pass on your arguments to the college of quaestors so that they can adopt the resolution that they think best and so that it will be known to all members . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
are there any comments ? 
mr president , i just wished to point out that i forgot to sign the attendance register yesterday evening . 
we will take note of it . 
( the minutes were approved ) 
however , we will do everything we can to ensure that we will be able to debate it here in the next part - session of the new year . 
thank you very much , mr varela . 
the control system has proven to be a first rate system and we should spare no effort to strengthen and develop it further . 
the commission therefore supports the council 's request for urgent procedure and calls on the members of the european parliament to support this urgent procedure . 
mr varela , chairman of the committee on fisheries , the committee responsible , has the floor again . 
mr president , i should like to answer mr colom i naval on the issue of the use of the flexibility instrument in revising the financial perspective . 
in fact , the repeated use , two years in a row , of the flexibility instrument could be considered , wrongly in my opinion , to be a form of revision of the financial perspective . 
personally , i think that this is not true in terms of procedure and certainly not in terms of substance . 
the procedure for the flexibility instrument was laid down in the interinstitutional agreement for the purpose , in exceptional cases , of funding specific expenditure over and above the ceilings agreed in berlin , without calling the financial perspective into question . 
furthermore , the council has defined a multiannual sum , admittedly indicative in nature , which is compatible with this financial perspective , for the framework programme for aid for reconstruction in the western balkans . 
after this illustration , which i am sure will be very useful to all members , we are going to do the round of the opinions of the various parliamentary committees . 
mr president , i wish to begin by thanking mrs haug for her hard work and her success in relation to small and medium - sized enterprises . 
that has been a high - order issue for the committee on industry , and we are very pleased with the success that she has achieved . 
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur , mrs haug , for the outstanding cooperation , and also the chairman of the committee on budgets , mr wynn . 
mr president , as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on development and cooperation , i would like first of all to say that the european parliament has scored a major victory in as much as the cuts in the latin american , asian and african poverty programmes have been made good . 
i would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the commission and the council for this . 
latin america , asia , africa and the balkans should be regarded as pillars of equal standing in our external policy and not played off against each other . 
this must shortly find expressio. as is clear from the debat. in the multiannual programme . 
secondly , it gives me great pleasure to note that there is support from the whole of parliament , right across the political spectrum , for the concrete objectives for tackling poverty , as have been proposed by the committee on development and cooperation in the 2001 budget , partly on the basis of the historical data provided by the european commission ; in particular , the doubling of the budgets for basic education and healthcare in the regional programmes for latin america , asia , africa and the european development fund , amounting to a total of around eur five million , is a huge step forwards . 
output instead of input . 
we are counting on robust instructions and spending from the european commission , in line with these objectives . 
in particular i would cite euronews so that people can see in the media what parliament and the union are doing . 
mr president , i would also like to thank mrs haug for her excellent work . 
i fully agree with the comments made by our colleague joan colom on the revision of the financial perspective . 
the amount for the common fisheries policy is scarcely 1 % of the community budget . 
however , this small quantity , which is essential for maintaining the activity of the sector and the economies of areas that are dependent on fisheries , is a very appetising snack , despite being small , each time we look at where to find money to fund new policies . 
commissioner , fish is an essential element for a healthy , balanced diet that is rich in proteins . 
when european consumers go to the market with concerns about what they can buy , in fish they find a safe , quality product . 
they will therefore think that this 1 % of the european union budget is being very well used . 
the 2001 budget gave rise to a fair amount of indignation among the members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the main reason being that 50 % of the prince information campaign was entered in the reserve . 
this decision would have prevented us from running the information campaign on the introduction of the euro in the year which matters , i.e. in 2001, at a time when uncertainty due to the fall in the value of the euro against the dollar and the need for information on the introduction of coins in 2002 are at their height . 
we have a budget which is under 1.06 % , we have a budget , mr colom , which is within the financial perspective . 
i suspect that , to put it simply , flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts , but we will see in the next few years how that will go . 
but i would like to thank both the commission and the presidency - in - office of the council for their remarks about the joint declaration which we have put together , because that is also a first indication of how we are going to monitor improvements and performance in the running of the programmes , particularly in category 4 . 
turning to that for a moment , we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by mrs schreyer , preferably before 30 june , so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget . 
but in thinking about the question of the backlog on commitments and how we limit the duration of new commitment. obviously this comes into the domain of the financial regulation which we will have to negotiate . 
we believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the european union institutions operate . 
a word on the reserve , madam president - in - office of the council . 
you said , if i understood you correctly , that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this . 
we use the reserve , particularly on first reading , to draw attention to particular points of weakness in the way in which policies are operating . 
the information policy in the institutions at the moment is a scandal and therefore , rather than putting money on the line for information policy when we know it is not being used effectively , we are going to be keeping much of that money in reserve waiting for the commission to come up with the right proposals . 
of course , the solution would be to allow us , as a joint budgetary authority , to lift funds being spent during the year and that may be an invention which we can insert into the revision of the financial regulation . 
lastly , i would say , looking to the future , that nice has shown us that there is perhaps a feeling that we are shifting a little bit towards intergovernmentalism , with the council deciding on the numbers of our parliament without our being consulted beforehand . 
our confidence as one of three institutions , will only be maintaine. and therefore the institutional agreement and the financial perspective maintaine. if we manage to create mutual confidence and if we are consulted at every stage on our fundamental interests . 
mr president , my thanks first and foremost to florence parly , who is just leaving but who , i think , is still within earshot . 
after the experiences of last year , i think she has created a very good atmosphere , both here and in the council , with the active commitment which she has shown throughout her presidency . 
i should also like to thank mrs schreyer , who has continued to help us with her highly constructive approach and , of course , my friend jutta haug , who has done an excellent job , not forgetting joan colom i naval and markus ferber . 
we are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next thursday . 
with unemployment still at over 8 % throughout europe , the european union needs to use the budget at its disposal to send out a clear message and to set about fighting this scourge in the economy to our citizens , which is why it is important that we have this 450 million at our disposal next year , starting with 100 million this year . 
it shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them . 
i am delighted that we have managed in category iv of this budget to show those living in the greatest need or in the process of democratising their countries throughout the world that this european parliament and this european union has not forgotten them , even if we have our own problems to resolve , and that here too we are making sure that there is enough money to go round . 
by refusing to discuss the specific long - term aspects of this challenge with us , you have brought the whole spirit of the interinstitutional agreement into question . 
you keep saying that the financial perspective is sacrosanct as far as you are concerned . 
but the interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security . 
the balkans and other regions need planning security . 
repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the interinstitutional agreement , because it was an instrument which this european parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to eur 600 million . 
with these observations , my group is prepared to adopt the draft budget . 
nonetheless , i should like expressly to agree with mr colom i naval , who said earlier that the financial perspective has become more and more of a straightjacket , preventing any real planning , any real long - term planning . 
constant use of the flexibility reserve is undermining the transparency of the budget and in time this too will lead to a loss of credibility . 
even the notenboom procedure , whereby funds are transferred to critical regions , in this case to fund the balkan stability pact , does not really guarantee a transparent budgetary procedure . 
it already looks likely that the huge risk of a clash between meda , mediterranean rim projects and the balkans will increase over the next few years , despite the fact that we all know that this is where money is urgently needed . 
on the other hand , we are also aware that the council is perfectly capable of suddenly questioning the financial perspective when it comes to bse , when it comes to national interests . 
i found mr chirac 's statement at the nice council extremely interesting . 
i think the council urgently needs to consider how it , for its part , intends to handle the financial perspective . 
in all events , parliament will be a much tougher negotiating partner next year . 
ladies and gentlemen , we are suspending the debate at this point in order to hear the president of the republic of france and of the european council . 
i wish to say , at the risk of destroying your illusions , that no one here has been fooled . 
the obstacles between the fifteen that multiplied during the summit are symptomatic . 
any clear - thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a federal europe of 27 or 28 member states is leading us . 
there is clearly something rotten about the whole business . 
portugal and belgium have , on this occasion , had a greater influence than france , which conceded on everything and obtained nothing apart from preserving a vague cultural exception , which is a pretext for a new concept , which mr védrine has invented , for the sake of the cause , of a sovereignty that would be both national and exercised jointly . 
even edgar faure must be turning in his grave ! 
at a time when these so - called leaders are incapable of transposing fifty or so directives except by edict , in other words , by decree - law , they are accepting , with straight faces , to reduce french representation in the european parliament by around 20 % , despite having given these representatives the task of protecting french interests under codecision . 
as far as france is concerned , each of these treaties is , unfortunately , worse than the one before , but they confirm the rationale of maastricht , a fine example of mitterrandesque finagling that is likely to end badly . 
and what about poor mr chirac , who believes what gerhard says , in the same way that jaurès believed in world peace ! 
nonetheless , from an austrian point of view , it is a result we can live with . 
in fact , i feel that it is right for all the states of the european union to be on the same summer time " . 
i congratulate my colleague mary honeyball on her first report for the european parliament . 
summer time should be a matter for the member states but it is right that the eu should harmonise the start and end dates . 
i welcome the agreement to continue to begin summer time on the last sunday in march and to end it on the last sunday in october . 
given the planning needs of certain sectors such as transport , communications , tourism and computer and other technology i welcome the proposal to make these arrangements permanent subject to a commission review every five years . 
summer time has , in practice , become normal time . 
mr president , i should like to give an explanation on the honeyball report . 
i am sorry , madam , but i have no record here of your application to give an explanation of vote . 
i went to the spanish police station immediately and reported the incident before you could say ' jack robinson ' . 
appropriate measures should be taken to provide crime victims with the following rights : to provide and receive information ; communications facilities ; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid ; a suitable level of protection and privacy ; the possibility to seek compensation under criminal procedure and to dispute settlement through mediation . 
the victim must be treated as a person in a particular situation of disorientation and distres. factors that are likely to be all the more acute if the crime happens to the victim in a member state other than his / her own . 
. although we support the content of the report and are very sympathetic to victims of crime throughout europe , i , as a british conservative , have reservations regarding certain aspects of the report . 
the tories , on the other hand , offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment . 
their record on law and order speaks for itself : during their time in office , the chance of being a victim of burglary increased from one in 32 to one in 13 ; the chance of being a victim of violent crime trebled . 
madam president , the labour government is determined to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime . 
by introducing greater protection for victims of crime across europe , our citizens will gain confidence in the judicial system and the police , not just across britain , but right across the european union . 
european council / french presidency ( continuation ) 
mr president , despite what the president of the republic says about the problems faced , in view of the spectacle at nice , one must question whether the union is really and truly prepared for enlargement . 
the candidates cannot have been pleased at the sight of the scramble for national power and status among the prime ministers . 
sadly the common cause of europe was a marginal factor . 
for the decisions on council voting and seats in parliament a more suitable venue would have been the casino at cannes rather than the acropolis at nice , with mr chirac playing the role of chief croupier . 
particularly regrettable was the failure to make reference to the charte. a failure that will bring legal uncertainty and political frustration . 
however , my greatest fear is that britain , france and germany will now be able to subvert the delicate balance developed between states of various sizes and between the institutions over several decades . 
yet this seems to be an even more distant dream than we had hoped now that nice is over . 
for the swedish negotiators , it would appear to have been more important to please the large member states than to fight for our own influence . 
sweden is therefore to be given fewer votes than comparable member states . 
it is hard to see what there is in the nice decisions which really makes enlargement of the eu any the easier . 
mr president , in the coming weeks we shall have to carry out a rigorous , in - depth analysis of the conclusions of the intergovernmental conference and the fundamental questions which it has thrown up . 
i will not go back to the comments of the different speakers regarding the method nor the other subjects such as those covered by mr brok just now . 
of the fundamental questions , the first is that the nice conclusions do not guarantee on an institutional level the necessary continuity and the necessary development of the process of integration into the larger union which is about to come into being . 
time will show us which issues we need to return to , whether we like it or not . 
the second fundamental issue is political rather than institutional . 
the atmosphere of the nice council , the lack of openness , as president prodi said , the blinkered vision characterising the attitudes of the different government. the narrow - minded defence of national interests or policie. explain , it is sad to say , the root of the problem : a serious loss of the sense of shared european interest , of a common european vision . 
well , the appropriate responses to both the institutional and political fundamental questions , which are our most negative legacy from the nice council , must be sought in dialogue , in the evaluation and development process which must be pursued under the title " the future of the union " . 
we must reflect seriously on what has happened . 
we managed to avoid an open crisis which would have threatened enlargement by coming to a last minute agreement on the treaty , but we are left with a latent crisis which will have to be dealt with . 
building a unified europe requires far - sighted vision and coherence . 
mr president , president chirac has played down the negative reactions of many of the members to the outcome of nice , describing them as unrealistic and not pragmatic . 
in reality , it is the president who is being unrealistic if he thinks that it will be possible to enlarge the union with such a treaty . 
in my opinion , it is not more realistic to fight for one 's own national prestige than to fight for the efficient functioning of the union , and i would not say that huge numbers of european citizens came out to follow the naval battle fought by their leaders at nice . 
my feeling is that the french presidency 's most serious error was to run the debate along the lines of a battle of powers between state. a mean , shameless fight over detail. rather than as a relevant debate on the union 's policies . 
terrified of jeopardising france 's equal voting rights with germany , the presidency docilely allowed its proposals to extend qualified majority voting to 40 or so subjects to be knocked down to less than half this number . 
yet even the pro - europe - states did little to fight for its cause and , in the end , bowed before a disappointing compromise . 
we truly hope this will be the last intergovernmental conference , considering that the summit revealed a breakdown in community solidarity . 
we have long known that the great europe could not be introduced through the institutions of the little europe . 
there is just one small satisfaction : enlargement . 
there was no answer to the question as to how the institutions of the european union could function more effectively in an enlarged union . 
but it all compares most unfavourably with the attention the council gave itself . 
four main problems loom large . 
firstly , institutional imbalance : a great deal for the council and not much for the commission and parliament . 
secondly , national interests have triumphed . 
when mr prodi says there are no more leftovers from nice , i would make so bold as to doubt his word . 
we must introduce qualified majority decision - making for the essential topics , or else the situation will become untenable . 
nice will go down in history as the summit of lost opportunity , the summit of lack of leadership in europe , the summit of opposition and the summit in whose wake the people felt even more isolated from the european union . 
mr president , the purpose of the intergovernmental conference was to prepare the european union so that it would be able to operate after enlargement . 
similarly , a number of positive moves were made as regards the european commission . 
as far as democratisation is concerned , the points worth noting are that codecision has been extended on several counts and the european legislator has been authorised to define the status of european political parties and crucial preventive measures to defend democracy and freedom in the member states . 
finally , the european parliament will face a huge dilemma when it comes to make its final appraisal of the treaty at the beginning of next year due to the clause on post - nice developments . 
i believe we will recommend ratification and moving forward to a new reform , but we must look at the small print to decide whether that is the right way forward . 
mr president , i apologise because my remarks are slightly ill - prepared . 
i have come straight from a meeting and , because there are no televisions in the meeting rooms in this building , it is very difficult to keep in touch with what is happening in the chamber , a deficiency which i hope will be corrected in due course . 
mr president , it has been said , and i think rightly so , that europe is born out of necessity and that only when necessity knocks at the door does europe decide to take a step forward . 
and necessity gave an urgent knock at the door of europe in nice , in the form of sclerosis as a result of the prospect of an enlarged europe . 
there can be many evaluations of what happened in nice , and we have had ample proof of that this morning and this afternoon in the continuation of the debate . 
but the european council in nice , like many other summits in the history of the european union , represents a triumph for reality , a triumph of pragmatism over utopianism . 
although we would all have liked to increase our powers in codecisio. and despite the disputes between large countries , between large and small countries and between small and medium - sized countrie. it is obvious that the following , although not spectacular , are all steps in the right direction , as president prodi said this morning : a commission whose president has his powers increased ; a decision - making process in which more decision. not all those that we would have wishe. are taken by qualified majority ; a clarification of the role of enhanced cooperation ; and als. why not come out with it. a reweighting , imperfect though it may be , of the votes in the council of ministers . 
but nice , mr president , is not the end of the road , but the starting point for a new phase with many challenges . 
we have to successfully complete accession , consolidate the internal market , deliver the single currency , develop a real common foreign and security policy and open up a new debate on the future of europe . 
these are challenges that cannot be overcome , mr president of the commission , with our backs to the people . 
and in order to do this we will need more generosity , more realism , a greater involvement of the institutions that defend the community interests , and in this type of conference , everyone will need to seek , as jean monnet said , and i will finish with this , their interest in the common interest . 
mr president , mr president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are winners and losers , but europe cannot claim to be one of the winners and democracy and transparency certainly cannot . 
that is , in fact , the gist of what president prodi said today in a commendably clear and unequivocal manner . 
let us take one thing at a time : the charter was not included in the treaty , not so much as a mention . 
progress was made on security and defence policy , it is true , but it has no parliamentary dimension . 
as far as qualified majority voting is concerned , it has only been extended slightly and the procedure is now even more complicated and less transparent than before . 
we do , of course , have reinforced cooperation , but how it will work remains to be seen . 
the ratio between large and small was , in the end , regulated in a perfectly reasonable manner , following a number of totally obtuse and unacceptable suggestions , and the commission has been strengthened , even if the link with the number of members is not necessarily an overly reasonable or clever decision . 
mr moscovici is without doubt quite right to say that talking about it among ourselves is not enough ; we must tell the people about it . 
if we compare the convention with what happened at the intergovernmental conference , admittedly with less serious problems than at the intergovernmental conference and with fewer national interests than at the intergovernmental conference , then the convention and the modus operandi and methods of the convention clearly come out on top . 
i therefore take the view that we should only apply ourselves in detail to what has come out of nice once it is clear that the european parliament will have an important and decisive role in the future process . 
we want to prove to the heads of government that we know best . 
mr president , mr president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , all my colleagues have stressed the expectations that surrounded the nice summit , which was intended to allow the european union to continue operating effectively , democratically and transparently after the historic enlargement we are awaiting . 
certainly , the nice summit has made it possible to achieve significant progress on all the issues that directly affect the lives of our citizens , whether it be the preservation of health , the protection of the environment , social policy or indeed the adoption of a european company statute . 
another positive point is that the charter of fundamental rights has been officially proclaimed , even if it is not intended to be binding at this stage . 
finally , the decisions taken in the area of the common foreign and security policy represent undeniable progress . 
this summit would have been a triumph if the crucial revision of the treaties had been crowned with as much success as the areas i have just mentioned . 
in fact , while we seem to have succeeded in avoiding total paralysis of the future enlarged european union , it has not been possible to convert the ambitions of the french presidency into a new draft of the treaty . 
it worked well for the charter and it will also work better than a traditional igc . 
and it is more democratic to boot . 
mr moscovici says we should not blame him , we should blame other governments at the council . 
it is deplorable and the only hopeful sign is that the european commission has clearly recovered its sense of self - confidence . 
this european parliament will join with the european commission in insisting that our demands are met . 
mr president , the nice summit has shown that intergovernmental conferences have reached the end of their useful life . 
mr president , i will be very brief because the purpose of my speech is to thank you , to thank you not only for your kindness to us but also for what you have said . 
it is not courtesy which has prompted us to stay until the end of the debate , mr beazley : commissioner barnier and myself have stayed to hear your opinions , your convictions and your feelings , for it is my opinion that , if we are to build europe , parliament and the commission must do so together . 
we have been quite frank with each other in today 's debate about those parts of the treaty of nice which give us cause for satisfaction and even more open about those with which we are not content . our reasons are different in some cases but we share the same feelings and concerns . 
we have made no bones about the need to continue with the same force and the same determination as before nice , to achieve our objectives along the road to enlargement , which will be our greatest historical moment and which it is the responsibility of parliament and the commission to bring about in the coming years . 
we have also been completely clear , ladies and gentlemen , about the need for parliament and the commission to work together to build the new europe , for this arduous task is our responsibility , but ours is also this great mission and this great potential . 
thank you very much , mr president of the commission . 
the debate is closed . 
in addition , and above all , the problem of financing for the balkans will still be there in its entirety for the years ahead . 
heading 3, internal actions , also warrants a comment , since the ' employment initiative ' , re - baptised the ' spirit of enterprise programme ' has been amputated to the tune of eur 87 million , the trans - european networks by eur 23 million , and environmental protection by eur 42 million . 
in total , with about 1.09 % of european gross domestic product , or even less , the 2001 budget will be one of the lowest of the last ten years , in relative terms , since it is well below the already very restrictive ceiling established under agenda 2000 in berlin in march 1999 . 
mr president , i would like to start by stressing the fact that this year 's budget is due in particular to the work of all the members of the committee itself , in addition , of course , to the work of the committee chairman , mr wynn , who has steered us with wisdom through the various situations , and tense moments which we have experienced . 
i would also like to thank commissioner schreyer . 
however , this does not mean that we could have done more or better . 
i will focus on one aspect at a time . 
firstly , the positive side : the approximately eur 60 million of agricultural funds allocated for testing , which is a significant although , in my opinion , not conclusive step ; the earmarking of around eur 450 million for small and medium - sized businesses , for we have at last realised that the european economy is not based on multinationals but on small and medium - sized enterprises , which will give new impetus to development and employment ; then the fact that the increase in expenditure is only 3.5 % , and the increase in appropriations for the balkans , which is of political importance . 
in this sense , our committee has made a fundamental achievement . 
i would now like to focus on two points which i feel require some attention and give cause for concern : firstly , the possibly excessive use of flexibility which , like all excessive things , is a negative factor , which means that we must not use it as a safety net ; secondly , the fact that the creation of the new jobs is simply due to early retirements . 
this must not become a precedent in our institutions . 
finally , i urge the committee to adopt increasingly a budgetary strategy aimed particularly at strengthening and protecting our currency , the euro . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , and i would have said madam president of the council , but i do not see her among us . 
it is true that the chamber is pretty thin , but unfortunately the debate on the budget lasted longer than planned and w . i and the speakers who follow m. will not have the opportunity to raise the matter with the presidency . 
i , in my turn , would like to congratulate the rapporteurs , the chairman of the committee on budgets , the council and the presidency on the work that has been accomplished , and the conclusion of this agreement which will allow us to vote for the budget for the year 2001 . 
but i endorse all the comments made , especially by mr colom i naval , on this extremely delicate issue of the financial perspectives . 
however , i feel that when it comes to mounting such an extensive operation , we must take stock of the need for aid before opening our wallet . 
the zeal shown by the commission and parliament to equip the balkans with aid reserves , contrast sharply with the cuts in aid for the candidate states . 
mr president , we probably ought to reserve the flexibility instrument for the 2002 budget now for the candidate states . 
they might wish to join the eu earlier , completely out of the blue . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the principles of thrift and social and economic balance have been taken into account in drawing up the budget and the rapporteur must be thanked for that . 
it is also good that , as the main source of employment , small and medium - sized enterprises have been allocated additional funds . 
this will help to create new jobs and continue the fight against unemployment . 
we are also aware of the assumption behind the commission 's letter of amendment no. 2, i.e. that around 900 million can be saved in category i. however , this assumption no longer holds true . 
first , the euro has now gone up in value , thereby reducing any potential savings , and secondly , we must now assume that insufficient funds have been earmarked in the budget for dealing with the bse crisis . 
we shall therefore be forced to accept a supplementary budget which will again seriously reduce , if not eliminate any potential savings in this category . 
mr president , commissioner , i should like to begin by congratulating our colleague , the general rapporteur jutta haug , on the way in which she has done her job , which has contributed immensely to the constructive atmosphere in which our work has been carried out in committee and in parliament in general . 
the vote that is to follow this debate will mark the end of the long , complex process of approving the european union budget for 2001 . 
as a result of intense negotiations and successive compromises among the various institutions , the chances of its approval are reasonable . 
however , i should like to point out certain aspects that carry over to subsequent years . 
the budget represents , in payment appropriations , just 1.056 % of the community gdp . 
in football terms it is like a l - 1 draw . 
however , because of the flexibility instrument , we think we have won the penalty shoot - out . 
the commission 's original proposal for a revision of the financial perspective to take eur 300 million from category 1 for category 4 was a worthy idea : worthy of support and eminently sensible . 
unfortunately , a majority of my colleagues did not agree with me and therefore we could not go along with it . 
neither was there a qualified majority within this house to revert to article 272 . 
therefore , we had to find a solution within the means that the interinstitutional agreement affords us so that we could get a decent budget . 
that is what we have done : we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to article 272 ; the financial perspective has been maintained , even though we have used the flexibility instrument . 
the result is the best that we can hope for without either a revision or article 272 . 
just because we have a budget and we have agreed a deal at conciliation , let us not imagine that all our problems have disappeared . 
the problems will remain until we sort out what we are going to do about external expenditure . 
there are times when i foolishly assumed this year that once the commission had made its proposals for a revision we could reach an agreement with the council . 
i was wrong . 
then when i discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding article 25 of the iia , i was , to say the least , somewhat disappointed . 
the council 's attitude in this game of football seems to be not to worry about the ball but to get on with the game . 
let me just say to the council that , as far as this game is concerned , we have not run out of balls and this side intends playing until we get the right result . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , representative of the council , rapporteurs , each budgetary year the european parliament gains budgetary importance . 
we do not gain this importance out of nowhere , but from the treaties , although sometimes the council finds it hard to admit it . 
last year , with the bourlanges report , the flexibility instrument was mobilised for the first time , and an institutional declaration was also obtained recognising the possible financial insufficiency of category 4 . 
this year , the haug report has taken advantage of this institutional declaration last year to discuss the need to revise the financial perspective . 
it has been demonstrated that it was not the right time for a revision , that there was enough margin to fulfil the commitments to the balkans and to the meda programme without altering the forecasts of berlin 1999, and it has been shown that the compulsion to have a revision is only in the intentions of those who voted against agenda 2000 in its day . 
however , the european parliament cannot carry on forever reducing its external commitments . 
this year the flexibility instrument has been used again , but we should not continue down this road . 
we do not want there to be a proposal for revision for next year in the colom resolution , because we want to wait for the world bank evaluation , but we share his criticism that this method of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major external objectives of the union and the very definition of the financial perspective . 
this time , more than ever , the secret of success will be in correctly implementing the budget . 
mr president , commissioner , i must first congratulate the general rapporteur , mrs haug , the president of the commission and my colleagues who have been involved in negotiations on the excellent work that they have done . 
the final outcome of the negotiations is positive , which shows that in order to achieve some objectives , what matters is not getting there alone and early , but getting there altogether and on time . 
as i see it , there is a major threat in the present - day situation , namely bse . 
it is nonetheless important to note that we must cope successfully with this too within the current budget framework . 
this means that , if the solution to the problem requires still more money , this must be provided by means of other savings in category 1 or through the member states ' accepting a larger portion of the cost . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i intend to focus on one fundamental point in my comments on the budget lines for environmental , public health and consumer protection policy . 
generally - speaking , the proportion of the budget earmarked in order to safeguard and maintain the environment is far too small . 
this is particularly annoying in that environmental policy is a horizontal policy because environmental polic. or at least successful environmental polic. must be applied as a cross - border policy . 
we all know that . 
which is why safeguarding and regenerating the environment is a job which has to be done at european community level . 
but this also means that we need to be given proper funding once and for all . 
we cannot just keep on issuing endless directives and regulations , often without sufficient background information , scientific basis and generally to unbelievably short deadlines . 
only then shall we be able to work out realistic prospects , prospects for linking environmental and health policies to other policy areas , prospects for what promises to be a successful and realistic approach to problem - solving . 
during the conflict in bosnia , europe was still not in a position to speak with one voice : one country was purported to be on the side of the serbs , another to be on the side of the croats . 
we almost seemed to be back in the policy of alliances of the 19th century . 
now , at the end of this century , at the end of the 1990s , europe is speaking with one voice , europe is the biggest civil reconstructor in the balkans , bigger than the united states , and is doing a good job ; through its budget and its policy it really did help to make peaceful revolution possible in serbia . 
this needed to be said quite clearly about european policy at the end of this financial year and after this decade of confusion in the balkans . 
foreign states are becoming more important to us and we hope that , with the new posts provided , the commission will do the job which we expect it to do . 
we are being up front with our praise and you may be sure that we shall seek to exercise strict control in the future . 
there is much talk of post - nice . 
nice was yet again the scene of national haggling for individual states . 
we have overcome this to a considerable degree in foreign policy and i hope in the forthcoming budget debates that we shall take more decisions of substance and spend more time on the problems and less time haggling over national interests in this budget . 
mr president , honourable members , i only intend to comment on certain aspects raised during the debate . 
first , the structure of the budget in 2001 : one speaker said that the agricultural budget would not rise sufficiently . 
however , i must stress that the agricultural budget has a very high rate of growth , namely 5.7 % . 
if we include the expected supplementary budget , it comes out at nearly 8 % , while other areas , such as training policy , the whole of internal polic. including research - , foreign policy , administration and accession aid have together only risen by 1.1 % . 
we really must stress , therefore , that parliament too has exercised immense budgetary discipline in the areas in which it has the last word but has , i think , brought about an excellent result with clear priorities nonetheless . 
on mr mulder 's comment : you noted that , because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy , the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation , because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar . 
i would draw your attention here to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement , which state that a " currency risk " of up to eur 200 million must be financed from the agricultural policy and that only then can recourse be taken to the currency reserve . 
may i also point out that the eur 4.5 billion under agricultural policy for developing the countryside , which we discussed this morning , includes numerous measures to promote environmental protection . 
in addition , agricultural policy also includes something in this area which is not standard practice in environmental policy and which fundamentalists may occasionally take a dim view of : namely that compensation is paid for refraining from taking environmentally damaging action . 
here are your measures which quite explicitly promote environmental protection . 
you are , of course , quite right to keep reverting to this question . 
i guess this example also illustrates the fact that sometimes principles count for more than budgetary intentions . 
i think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving serbia the help it needs on this occasion , although i fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a european flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of europe to another , depending on where it is needed . 
in closing , i should like once again to stress that , in the commission 's view , the 2001 budget provides an excellent basis on which we can together forge a good community policy for europe and i should like to thank you for the excellent cooperation . 
and we shall have the opportunity of continuing this excellent cooperation on the supplementary budget in january . 
but first i should like to wish all those involved in the budget a happy christmas ! 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
parliament also wishes you a happy christmas . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place on thursday from 10.00 a.m . 
common strategy towards the russian federation 
mr president , our relations with russia underwent a fundamental change when the cold war ended . 
as far as cooperation with russia is concerned , the russian response to the strategy document of the european union offers some good starting points . 
the entry into force of scientific and technological cooperation with the russian federation is a good example . 
in addition , it is possible to achieve various forms of cross - border cooperation that will prevent sharp disparities in wealth from arising . 
initiatives concerning cooperation with the region of kaliningrad fit into the same framework . 
we would argue in favour of having a separate budgetary line for developing this northern dimension in a coherent manner , along the lines of the one that we already have for cooperation with the three baltic states . 
however , i am of the opinion that the importance of russia is not really reflected in the budget , but we disagree with the social democrats on that score . 
if you take a close look , then roughly speaking , russia is slightly ahead of morocco in terms of budgetary importance , which cannot be right to my mind . 
i could live with it though , if recital g on this aspect were to lapse , and in so doing if it were to be possible , with the support of the social democrats , to achieve a broader majority for this resolution , because this would send out a clearer signal to russia . 
we are hoping that the cooperation will extend to external policy . 
the resolution refers to the commission as the initiator of policy and to the high representative as the coordinator of policy . 
there are various regions where we could start the ball rolling , such as the balkans , the caucasus region and central asia . 
mr president , russia has yet to come to terms with herself , to decide what sort of society she wants to create and define her position in the world . 
for over seventy years , her development was distorted and held back by the monstrous experiment of communism which grew to threaten us all . 
i must say i very much welcome mr oostlander 's report for its very reasonable and balanced approach , praising constructive reforms while criticising blatant human rights abuses . 
but let me say a couple of words about our strategic relationship . 
while encouraging a strong economic relationship between the european union and russia coupled with efforts at political cooperation , we must take care that we do not create for ourselves some sort of strategic dependency . 
for example , it has been suggested in the context of european defence polic. about which i have to say we continue to have reservation. that the european union might turn to russia to provide strategic airlift capabilities to complement the arrangements already in place between the weu and ukraine . 
dozens of tons of waste plutonium have to be destroyed as a result of disarmament negotiations . 
slyness does not become us : we must build a europe of economic cooperation . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think we should pay tribute to mr oostlander for having stressed the importance of the role of the commission and , in particular , of mr patten as the commissioner responsible for external relations , in the implementation of this common strategy . 
contrary to what previous speakers have said , i do not believe that this strategy has been successful to date . 
unfortunately , the major financial scandals which continue to punctuate relations between russia and international finance , and a number of projects involving the international community , clearly illustrate as much . 
i have put forward a number of amendments intended to place rather more emphasis on these issues . 
mr oostlander does not customarily welcome my amendments and i was not therefore very surprised to see that they had not been included . 
regarding chechnya , in particular , i do not think it is possible to say , mr oostlander , that the solution cannot be purely military . 
i think that the solution cannot be military , as the situation clearly demonstrates , and that it can only be political . 
nor do i think it acceptable , moreover , to fail to state that it is absolutely intolerable , after one and a half years of war in chechnya , that our commissioner for humanitarian aid , mr nielson , has not yet truly set foot in chechnya . 
nor do i think it acceptable that the european union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in chechnya . 
these are not isolated instances but repeated occurrences . 
a member of my party , a radical militant journalist , was murdered several weeks ago in tbilisi , a city clearly under the control of russian troops . 
i do not feel the commission and the council can fail to respond to an event of such seriousness . 
mr van orden is quite right in what he says regarding the caucasus . 
we are currently witnesses to an absolutely dreadful deterioration of the situation in georgia . 
the country is completely destabilised , literally strangled by the russian federation . 
it is on the point of collapse and the european union is offering no practical response to this rejection , this ban by the russian authorities regarding the introduction of visas . 
these symbols are perhaps not as contradictory as they first appear , each reflecting as it does a facet of an authoritarian state . 
in the political sector , the common strategy towards the russian federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue . 
it would be interesting to expound on this , but time is too short . 
and indeed , what does freedom mean for the chechen people ? 
belarus is therefore in political union with russia . 
it is important for us to emphasise the seriousness of this for russia too . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , questions of human rights are important to us , and they are not the private affairs of any one country . 
i very much welcome this report and i should like to pay tribute to mr oostlander for producing it . 
his report has been welcomed by all parts of parliament except , perhaps by those who look back with nostalgia to the not - so - golden days memorialised by a very large number of brave soviet dissidents . 
but it is an excellent report which , like the common strategy itself , underlines the importance that we attach to the relationshi. the strategic partnershi. between the european union and russia . 
the report endorses what is being called our " double track strategy " towards russia , a strategy that combines plain speaking on issues like chechny. to which i will return in a few moment. with a continuing effort to build an effective relationship based on shared values and cooperation . 
the common strategy and russia 's medium - term strategy for relations with the eu have created a new dynamism . 
the common strategy identified initiatives in foreign policy , security and the fight against crime . 
other areas where we seek to bolster european union cooperative efforts towards russia are the rule of law and democracy building , civil society , twinnings as well as regional and cross - border cooperation and , above all , the northern dimension initiative , to which a number of members referred . 
we strongly support the russian government 's economic reform programme which is vital to improve the investment climate . 
in this context , as parliament will know , at the last summit between the european union and russia , romano prodi launched a far - reaching dialogue on energy . 
these are all areas in which the commission has a powerful contribution to make , as the report repeatedly makes clear . 
our technical assistance programm. in particular taci. already responds to many of the priorities identified by this report . 
the core tacis programme , worth eur 34 million , focuses on education , the rule of law , democracy and civil society development , including regional media freedom , protection of individual rights and support to self - government . 
i very much hope to visit kaliningrad myself in the early part of next year , and not just because immanuel kant spent the whole of his life there . 
it is a serious issue that we need to address as part of the northern dimension . 
in all of the areas i have outlined we are working closely with russia to our mutual benefit . 
we must avoid the mistake to which an honourable gentleman referred earlier , which was made at the start of the last century , when russia was effectively excluded from european affairs after the leninist revolution in 1917 with disastrous consequences . 
we call upon the states of the region to use the osce mechanisms to resolve their disputes quickly before real damage can be caused . 
i congratulate the honourable gentleman once again on an extremely good report on a very important issue , to which i am sure we will return in this parliament over the next few years again and again . 
the honourable gentleman has given us a very important and useful political and intellectual infrastructure for our future discussions . 
we have a question , we are entitled to ask a supplementary question and we certainly expect to have a proper response from the council of ministers . 
that is why we have come here . 
mr president , i hope you will remonstrate with the council . 
we are involved in a highly regimented procedure here : the council is required to give answers to a great many extremely specific questions in a very short period of time and there is , i believe , no one here who would claim to be able to expand upon extremely complex social issues in just one minute . 
it would be both unwise and foolish for the council to attempt to do so . 
i am therefore perfectly willing to propose that such a debate be held , on condition that the most appropriate forum is chosen . 
i feel that it would be irresponsible of me to give impromptu answers regarding gmos in only a minute , and that would not be in keeping with the policy of this presidency . 
question no 2 by ( h - 0871 / 00 ) : 
subject : situation in chechnyahow does the council assess the present situation in chechnya , and what efforts has it made in the last six months to try to stop the bloodshed ? 
the council continues to be deeply concerned by the situation in chechnya , where violence continues and the humanitarian situation continues to be very worrying at the onset of winter . 
for the moment there are no signs of a political settlement to the conflict . 
the council has expressed its concern at many meetings with russia at all levels , particularly seeking to induce russia to avoid the excessive use of force and to avoid any extension of the conflict , to carry out independent and efficient inquiries into human rights violations , to support the osce assistance group in fulfilling its mission and , finally , to ensure that humanitarian aid is distributed properly . 
in particular , the council has pointed out that only a political solution could bring this crisis to an end . 
at the last eu - russian summit on 30 october 2000 in paris , the matter was raised by both presidents . 
mr putin agreed that there was an urgent need to find a solution of this kind . 
for the first time , russia accepted wording to this effect in the joint declaration issued following the summit . 
secondly : has the council obtained information from the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , who is well represented locally ? 
i do not have information exact enough to enable me to answer your supplementary question . 
all i can say is that we shall continue to liase closely with the commissioner for human rights . 
mr president - in - office of the council , we in parliament have tried in vain to urge mr nielson , the commissioner responsible for humanitarian matters , to visit chechnya , not just for the sake of an official visit but to carry out a serious survey of the humanitarian situation . 
we have not succeeded in convincing him . 
could the french presidency take the baton from us and contact mr nielson , urging him to go to chechnya in the near future ? 
the commission will , naturally , be informed of the content of our debates . 
mr president , a point of order : it is standard practice in the house for questions which cannot be adequately answered orally to be submitted in writing . 
i would ask the president - in - office to at least answer our questions in writing if he cannot do so orally . 
as you know , we are studying ways of reorganising our work . 
one of the points covered by the document presented by vice - president provan is the form to be taken by question time to the council and the commission . 
effectively , we have noted that council , commission and members of parliament have all been somewhat dissatisfied on several occasions . 
therefore , if the council so wishes , it can reply in writing , as you request . 
please do not get agitated . 
( interruption by mr posselt ) 
please , that is enough ; this is really a trivial issue . 
i am simply trying to present a procedural issue . indeed this is something about which i have written to your president , nicole fontaine , and she agrees with me . 
mr president , i think the question was quite specific . 
the member in question , that is yours truly , did attempt to approach the commission , which informally provided him with information regarding a situation which could be described as a deadlock . 
this directive dates from 1992 . 
the problem is well - know. common knowledge in fac. and it is part of the more serious issue of tax evasion , to which we are all extremely sensitive , but it is also extremely damaging to the firms which have no way of coordinating or monitoring it at all . 
this is why i have had to approach the council . 
i now take note of the fact that you have spoken of an undertaking . 
as a supplementary question , i would like to ask whether you are in any way able to forecast your action , seeing as the commission appears to be ready and willing whereas , if i am not mistaken , there seems to be some reticence or disagreement within the council . 
i would be extremely happy if you could dispel this doubt , for i am sure that all will then proceed very quickly . 
i can give you the council position , which is that , in general , the current situation regarding fraud in the area of both indirect and direct taxes and the possibility of stepping up administrative cooperation in these areas were discussed quite recently at the ecofin council meeting of 5 june 2000 . 
the proposal the honourable member refers to is an initiative from the french presidency with a view to the adoption of a council directive on the harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers transporting third country nationals to member states ' territory without the necessary documents for entry . 
this text , which was presented to the european parliament for consultation on 6 september 2000, is currently being examined by the competent council bodies . 
question no 5 by ( h - 0882 / 00 ) : 
subject : everything but arms proposalis the council content that this proposal from the commissio. which may well have dire consequences for already hard - pressed sugar beet farmers in the european unio. should be passed without any consultation of the directly - elected european parliament ? 
i should like to repeat a question which i asked mr moscovici last week in plenary . 
perhaps he had too many questions to deal with to be able to answer me then . 
perhaps you could answer me in these more intimate surroundings this evening . 
question no 7 by ( h - 0932 / 00 ) : 
subject : immediate danger from bovine spongiform encephalopathythe continuing cases of ' mad cow ' disease have made consumers , as well as livestock producers , extremely worried . 
as a precautionary measure and in order to eliminate risks of cross - contamination , the council has decided to suspend , as of 1 january 2001, the use of meat meals in feedingstuffs for production animals . 
finally , non - tested animals aged above thirty months may no longer enter the food chain . 
a purchase and destruction system is to be set up for such non - tested bovine animals , in order to compensate livestock farmers at the market price . 
the council considers that this package of measures should make it possible to avoid the risk which the honourable members have decried . 
regarding the method of organisation and the criteria for the development of livestock farming , the council would point out that , in the context of its decisions taken under the agenda 2000 reform , emphasis has been placed on greater incentives for extensive production , particularly by means of bonuses . 
furthermore , on 4 december 2000, the council noted the commission statements on the cultivation of protein - rich crops and called upon this institution to look more deeply into this matter in the near future and to draw conclusions with reference to current policy in this sector and with regard to set - aside , including , if necessary , by presenting appropriate proposals . 
however , in consideration of the need to uphold the principles governing the internal market , it aims to favour community - wide measures over measures concerning specific member states . 
. ( fr ) i have already had the opportunity , a few weeks ago , to express my comments to you on the preparations for the un general assembly special session devoted to reviewing the results of the world summit for children which is to take place in september 2001 . 
at that time i stressed the importance of preparing thoroughly for this event and the truly fundamental role which the european union should play in these preparations . 
consequently , on 20 november 2000 last , on the anniversary of the adoption of the convention on the rights of the child , the ministers of the members states with responsibility for matters relating to children and a commission representative met in paris and adopted shared commitments which will contribute to enhancing european union action in making preparations for this special session . 
regarding the reference to the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights , there has been no change to the commission proposal . 
the partnership agreement contains a number of references to the european convention on human rights . 
in addition , it stresses the need to enhance the legal avenues for remedying human rights violations . 
it moreover stresses the importance it attaches to improving the judicial apparatus and the training of turkish magistrates , particularly in the field of human rights . 
regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes , the text of the accession partnership agreement points out , in accordance with the conclusions of the helsinki european council , that this issue is an important matter , to be dealt with in the context of the political dialogue between the european union and turkey . 
like the other candidate countries , turkey must make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes . 
i thank the minister for his reply . 
this question was submitted while the issue of the partnership was still pending . 
i appreciate how tiring the past days must have been and i shall therefore focus my second question on the subject of the loïzidou case , i.e. the judgment against turkey by the court of human rights in strasbourg in the matter of the seizure of the property of greek cypriots in the occupied section of the island . 
with regard to individual cases such as those mentioned in my supplementary question , how can the council claim that a process of mutual recognition will of itself make any improvement at all ? 
. ( fr ) as the council has emphasised to the honourable member in the previous answer , the process of the mutual recognition of judgements will afford better protection of individuals ' rights . 
the mutual recognition of judgements will in fact make it possible to better guarantee personal security as it will facilitate the fight against crime on european union territory by improving judicial cooperation . 
in the long term , the conduct of inquiries and the prosecution of offences will cease to suffer from the limitations due to the diversity of national legal systems . 
next , mutual recognition affords improved legal safety within the european union in that as it ensures that a judgement pronounced in one state will not be called into question in another member state . 
i have no further information to give you . 
i think we simply have a little misunderstanding here . 
what i am in fact trying to explain to you is that the council is indeed taking action to meet your expectations . 
question no 14 by ( h - 0899 / 00 ) : 
subject : mandate of the rapid reaction forcean eu rapid reaction force is currently being set up . 
what has been decided about the mandate on the basis of which these troops will be deployed , and for what purposes will they be deployed ? 
it is up to the council to decide upon the possible launch of a military operation conducted by the european union as part of the petersberg assignment . 
in accordance with article 23 of the treaty on european union , the council shall adopt this decision unanimously , as is the case , moreover , for any other decision with implications in the area of defence . 
it is , furthermore , up to each member state to take a sovereign decision at national level whether or not to commit their national forces to the operation . 
the nice european council recorded the conditions which might lead the council to take a decision in a crisis situation . 
according to these , with a view to setting up an operation , the political and security committee ( cops ) may submit a recommendation to the council on the basis of advice from the military committee . 
the council , whose deliberations are prepared by coreper according to the customary procedures , may take a decision on the basis of this . 
question no 22 by ( h - 0918 / 00 ) : 
subject : bearing of taxes on the operation of the internal marketin an article in the financial times in november this year , the commission president , mr prodi , affirmed that he does not want to see tax harmonisation and common tax levels in the eu by stating that tax rates ' are in the hands of the national parliaments and must remain so ' . 
at the same time , in the same article , he considers that , in order for the eu to become dynamic and competitive , there is a need to switch to majority voting on taxes ' where necessary for the internal market to function ' . 
which taxes does the council consider to have no bearing on the dynamic and competitive operation of the internal market ? 
with your permission , mr president , that will be the last question that i shall be able to answer during this question time . 
it is not therefore up to the council to state an opinion on this matter . 
i should just like to point out that the treaty system differentiates between taxes and indirect taxes which must be harmonised in order to ensure the proper establishment and smooth running of the internal marke. according to article 9. and the approximation , laid down in article 94, of legislation which has a direct bearing on the establishment or running of the common market , including legislation on direct taxation . 
the decisions taken by the council on the basis of articles 93 and 94 were taken according to the rule of unanimity . 
however , efforts are clearly being made and the results of structural and economic reform can already be seen , especially in the transparent procedures being used for privatisation and the protection being offered to foreign investment . 
the stability , or rather stabilisation and association agreement , which provides for financial aid and general financial assistance through the relevant community programmes , will strengthen this progress in the economic sector and speed up preparations for croatia 's accession to the european union at a later date . 
the progress made by croatia is evident not only in the economic sector but also in the political sector . 
the new coalition voted in during recent elections in croatia has decided to put its money on democracy and the rule of law . 
this embracing of democracy and the rule of law go beyond mere words to daily actions : institutions are being created and legislatio. such as the legislation on protection for refugees , the right to asylum and immigratio. is being reformed . 
also worth mentioning here are the attempt by certain representatives of the croat community in bosnia to destabilise the government in order to recreate the wartime statelet of herzeg - bosna and the government 's compliance with the terms of the dayton agreement and collaboration with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . 
progress has clearly also been made in the social sector and at this point , i need do no more than read you an extract from the conclusions of the council of europe : 
mr president , the report on the stabilisation and association agreement takes account of the new democratic developments in croatia and highlights the european prospects for this country , which has managed in the course of the past year to achieve its aim of joining the international community of states . 
its membership of the nato partnership for peace and of the world trade organisation , its bilateral agreements with the efta states , its free - trade agreements with the cefta member states and the negotiations that began recently , on 8 november , on a wide - ranging stabilisation and association agreement with the european union are all evidence that croatia has embarked on a clear change of course since the elections of 3 january 2000 . 
the european union emphasised this again by the summit held in zagreb on 24 november . 
however , it also became clear at this summit that the situation inside yugoslavia remains as brittle and strife - ridden as ever . 
if this pattern of behaviour continues , where in case of doubt each party fights the other , it could break up the stability pact for south - east europe , which is based on regional cooperation . 
for even now states like croatia are asking whether the obligation to cooperate on a regional basis might not end up delaying their own accession to europe . 
croatia , like a more democratic serbia , where i hope that democracy will be consolidated on 23 december , could become major factors of stability in these regions destroyed by wars and ethnic conflicts . 
however , let me emphasise that even though we welcome this progress , this does not mean we think croatia has reached its goal . 
it must now take the next steps towards legislative reform , especially in relation to minority rights , freedom of the press and an independent judiciary . 
it is up to the commission to take a very critical look at precisely these aspects now in preparation for the stability and association agreement . 
let me also stress that croatia is endeavouring to put its relations with neighbouring states in good order . 
that means it really has made quite positive progress here . 
it is particularly important to show croatia that we regard it as quite crucial what role it takes on with regard to stabilisation in bosnia and herzegovina and the federation there . 
indeed , that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure croatia 's progress towards stabilisation . 
i think it would be a disaster for the eu to tie economic support to an agreement on the return of the refugees in the association and stabilisation agreement . 
that issue must be based on other conditions , namely whether access to asylum in croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum . 
i believe this question has to be treated separately and must not be part of the agreement . 
mr president , our group supports the work done by mr baltas on the report on the feasibility of negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with the republic of croatia . 
we also think that the commission has acted at the appropriate time to launch this proposal . 
we think that the work has been done in record time , and we congratulate mr baltas on his efficient work in committee . 
we should not forget the suffering of the almost three hundred thousand people , of serbian origin , who were violently expelled in a week , by terrorist methods , from krajina , and had to flee to serbia . 
i think it is important to recognise that it was wrong and that those people be helped to return , if they wish , to their homes . 
that would prove that tolerance , living together in harmony and respect for different opinions are possible in the balkan region and it would improve the prospects for our future in the area . 
in 1991 / 92 more than 250 000 croats were expelled from kraijina , from western and eastern slavonia . 
they were not able to return to their homes until the , to my mind , justified ­ recapture of these areas . 
there they found their property and possessions in ruins . 
unfortunately , during this recapture serbs who had the right to live there were expelled in return , not just by the croats but sadly also by their serb ringleaders , who , of course , did the same in bosnia and herzegovina and in sarajevo . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , when the commission issued its communication on relations between indonesia and the european union a year ago , indonesia seemed to be on the way to a true democracy under the wahid government , which had newly taken office . 
a year on , the picture looks far less optimistic . 
the road to democracy , to respect for human rights , to a sound administrative and legal system , to the eradication of corruption , seems to be a long road beset with obstacles . 
here is a great deal of opposition to the wahid government and the process appears to have come to a standstill . 
this opposition to the democratically elected government comes from various quarters , from military circles , from the supporters of the corrupt suharto regime , from groups of fanatical muslims , and from armed militia circles . 
there are still some papuan leaders under lock and key too . 
we expressly wanted to respect the territorial integrity of indonesia in our resolution , but surely that cannot mean the people of irian jaya having to renounce their own culture and identity ? 
that sort of violence only stirs up feelings of hatred . 
i would like to lend my voice to the warning issued by the united states government to the effect that the violence must stop . 
the eu ought to take the same line . 
finally , economic relations with indonesia are now based on the asean agreement . 
so far , the asean countries have made little progress as regards economic integration , even though the establishment of a free - trade zone between the members has been mooted for years now . 
my committee has therefore asked to conclude a bilateral cooperation agreement between the european union and indonesia . 
there is no doubt that cooperation with indonesia should be strengthened , and it should be directed into support for the authorities of this country in fields such as improvements in administration , the fight against fraud and corruption , the judicial system , environmental protection and improvements , or humanitarian aid for the displaced and refugees . 
i believe the report by our colleague , mrs maij - weggen , who in fact knows the situation well , satisfactorily addresses these aspects and therefore deserves our full approval . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs maij - weggen on the excellent job she has done . 
the democratisation process in indonesia deserves due recognition and therefore support . 
one of the clearest expressions of this process , but also of the contradictions that make it so fragile , was what happened in east timor . 
when the right to self - determination had been accepted , in the time between the popular vote and the recognition of the result , armed militias supported by indonesian troops executed a detailed plan to destroy public infrastructure and thousands of homes , ruin crops and farming implements , and persecute the population , which , in terror , took refuge in the mountains and in west timor . 
there are still contradictions like this in indonesia , whether in the moluccas , aceh or irian jaya , and they are still manifest in east timor too . 
the justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in indonesia and reveal the fragility of the democratisation process . 
we can support the democratisation process , as we have been doing ; what we cannot do is take the place of the protagonists in this process . 
mr president , indonesia is struggling but is emerging victorious . 
the revolution in the country and the way in which it took place , remain the basis for cautious optimism . 
the country is not unique in that respect . 
after all , these problems are characteristic of a country that is having to undergo a multifaceted transition . 
it must develop a new identity with a better balance between the centre and peripheral areas . 
on the economic front , the market must throw off the shackles of far - reaching state interference and attract new investment . 
the poverty issue is extremely pressing . 
old structures must be dismantled so that indonesia can at last get a grip on itself . 
many current problems are down to a lack of democratic control , for example over those parts of the army that resist change and loss of privilege . 
in many places , violence prevails over dialogue . 
mr president , the traces of suharto are very far from erased in indonesia . 
military influence may have been reduced but is still far too great . 
corruption is still rampant . 
but poor administration , where the military are left to wreak havoc undisturbed , feeds the desire for independence . 
irian jaya is also suffering the effects of migration policy . 
here too the local people are frustrated by the immigration of muslims and the hard line taken by the military . 
it is of paramount importance that those guilty of human rights violations are not allowed to get away with it . 
i concur with those of my colleagues who are demanding an immediate judicial inquiry into the murder of sander thoenes . 
mrs maij - weggen has written an outstanding report and i would therefore conclude that europe must do all it can to support the country on its way to democracy , but at the end of the day , it is up to the indonesians themselves to erase the traces of the suharto regime . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i shall begin by bringing two dates to your attention . 
here , tomorrow , we shall have the presentation of the sakharov prize . 
a year ago , this prize was , in fact , conferred on president xanana gusmão . 
as mrs maij - weggen pointed out here in her introductory statemen. which i emphatically support , together with the force of her repor. the situation in indonesia is deteriorating . 
we must learn from this lesson by sending indonesia clearer and unambiguous signals , not contradictory ones . 
i believe indonesia is a great country , but it is at a crossroads , and it depends on the efforts of the international community and the european union whether , at this crossroads , it will swing for good towards democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law , or whether the disorder will increase . 
to this end , we must learn to choose priorities : we cannot mix environmental issues , social policy issues or economic policy issues all at the same level as the key problem of respect for democracy and human rights , which clearly has to be a political priority in our relationship with indonesia . 
i also say we must give a clear signal , because we cannot have a two - speed policy : sometimes we seem to criticise but then we seem to do nothing . 
mr president , i congratulate mrs maij - weggen on an excellent report . 
i know she has great experience of indonesia and , in particular , the indonesian moluccan community living in holland . 
the position we have to take regarding the territorial integrity of indonesia is simple : we have to abide by international law and by the united nations resolution 2504 of december 1969 . 
it is important that we should not confine ourselves to approving the report but that we should follow it up . 
so i welcome the fact that the commission document presents an overall strategy showing how it proposes to tackle the misuse of eu funds . 
however , i think the proposed period of five years , 2001 to 2005, is too long , for if we look back we will see that the issue of fighting fraud has been on the table for a long time now . 
a constantly growing budget has , unfortunately , also led to more irregularities and fraud . 
we must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently , especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure . 
that is equally necessary for the office and for the commission . 
we propose appointing a hearing officer to give some protection to the rights of the accused . 
we call on the eib and the ecb finally to accede to the interinstitutional agreement relating to olaf . 
the system for fighting fraud must finally be perfected by enhancing the penal judicial dimension . 
we support the commission 's proposal to appoint a european public prosecutor as a first step towards creating a european judicial authority , given that this is something parliament has long been calling for . 
this public prosecutor , assisted by deputy public prosecutors in each member state and supplemented by a judge in investigative procedures , in accordance with the ' corpus juris ' expert report , would satisfy the principle of legal certainty and subsidiarity by acting as a kind of investigative and coordination office , without encroaching on the powers of the competent national courts . 
i thank the commission for its efforts and its work .. . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , when it comes to money , we all know it is no joke . 
i expressly call on the commission to refrain from any interference in olaf 's activities . 
finally , i am in favour of appointing a european public prosecutor , so that those responsible for fraud face criminal prosecution . 
as early as may , this parliament called on the commission to present proposals for a first stage , during which the european public prosecutor would be responsible only for offences and crimes committed by members and officials of the eu institutions against the financial interests of the union . 
mrs schreyer , you have repeatedly emphasised to this house that as the commissioner responsible for fighting fraud you see it as your special task to guarantee olaf 's independence . 
please tell us whether you do or do not support mr brüner on this crucial issue . 
we know that the commission discussed this question at its last meeting , without coming to a decision . 
do tell us what you think will happen now on and how we can get out of this impasse ! 
we also have to convince the members of the national parliaments , because that is the only way we can go on working and make progress . 
we urgently need a step in this direction , in order to persuade our electors , and especially our taxpayers , that the fight against fraud really is taken seriously at european level too and that we shall seek to ensure that the same criteria apply at european as at national level . 
mr president , my group has a lot of sympathy for ensuring that the efforts to combat fraud , corruption and money laundering are more efficient , and we find it completely unacceptable that cross - border crime is increasing alarmingly and that the money which the member states ' tax payers hand over to the eu is administered so badly and is to such a large extent channelled away from the purposes for which it was intended . 
we can clearly see from the treatment of recent years ' auditors ' reports that powerful forces here in parliament too are busier preventing the clearing up of fraud than in prosecuting the people responsible . 
we welcome negotiations between the member states concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime , but we shall not submit our countries to a federal eu prosecution authority . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i voted against the theato report in committee and also in my group , the radical group , and i will vote against it tomorrow because of the manicheism and inward - looking attitude characterising both this report and the activities of the committee on budgetary control in general or , at any rate , some of its members . 
anything that is good derives from the committee on budgetary control and all that is bad comes from elsewhere ; this is why the report is full of references to the previous resolution . 
as we said three months ago , you would think that the whole world were under the rule of the committee on budgetary control alone . 
mr president , it is always a pleasure following mr dell ' alba , because he makes a british euro - sceptic sound very sensible in this place . 
i would very much like to congratulate the rapporteu. someone i like and admire as a person and politicia. on this report , but unfortunately i cannot . 
had it not been for the amendments concerning olaf being adopted at the committee stage , i would have struggled to find any part of this report to support . 
well , for those of us who are still wading through the court of auditors ' report , we will find that one definition of fraud against the community is the black marke. paying for goods à la belge , as they say in brussels . 
this is fraud against the community because the eu takes a small percentage of all vat transactions . 
so another question springs to mind : if the european public prosecutor is allowed to investigate every vat transaction across europe , how big will that office be ? 
there are so many other question. the relationship with olaf , who appoints the european public prosecutor , who they report to and how it affects the member state. that i am afraid i am urging the british conservatives and others to vote against this report . 
mr president , i have to follow mr dell ' alba and mr heaton - harris and this will be tough . 
i would like to congratulate mrs theato on her report and in particular for making the effort to come here as i know she is not feeling very well tonight . 
the report deals with the protection of the community 's financial interests and how we deal with that and these are the major questions . 
it is always the area where we see hugely inflamed headlines in the papers and we need to tackle these issues seriously otherwise we are going to continue with a largely eurosceptic public like the people represented by mr heaton - harris . 
we must also remember that fraud also concerns money that is not collected , something that happens very often . 
we lose serious amounts of money because it is not collected by the member states . 
it is interesting that several countries , however much they protest about fraud , still have not signed up to the convention on the protection of the communities ' financial interests . 
i put an amendment down to name these countries because it is about time they were named and shamed . 
we need to bring these countries out into the open to reveal their hypocrisy . 
it was quite interesting to hear what mr prodi said today because he sounded quite enthusiastic about the european public prosecutor which is quite a shift from what we have seen in the past . 
i must emphasise , from the point of view of the political group , the amendment that was tabled by mr bösch was critical of the report because it talked about concentrating on the institutions of the european union , the public prosecutor being relevant only in that sense . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the fight against fraud detrimental to the european union is a high priority of the commission 's activities and is an important aim for the reform of the commission 's overall financial management . 
today we are debating mrs theato 's report on the commission 's report on its strategy for fighting fraud . 
the third line of action is common action by the european institutions to fight and prevent fraud in office , and here let me point out that the commission 's complaints against the eib and ecb because of the disputes about olaf are still pending and that the complaint by 70 members of this house against olaf 's investigative powers is still pending . 
finally , the fourth line of action concerns the penal judicial dimension , and along with it , the penal judicial consequences of established , detected or presumed fraud . 
here the overall situation remains as unsatisfactory as ever , especially as regards cooperation with the member states , not because of any unwillingness but because of the structural inadequacies and difficulties that exist in this field . 
that is also why the commission took the step of submitting a draft document on establishing a european public prosecutor 's office to the intergovernmental conference in nice . 
this situation has to change . 
i would like the member states , at least the presidency and the representatives of the member states being discussed , to be present for debates in plenary , and also in committee . 
mr president , i would like to start by commending the timeliness of this initiative and the diligence with which our rapporteur , eluned morgan , has carried it out . 
the aim of the discharge procedure is to analyse processes and procedures in force and to detect any inadequacies in them so that the institutions can then proceed to reform them . 
to achieve this aim fully , i shall highlight four requirements that i consider essential in the work of the budgetary control authority . 
first of all , balance in considering all the budget headings : it is unacceptable that the analysis of own resources performed by the court of auditors should explicitly exclude all revenue from undeclared economic activities , in contrast to the zeal with which it treats many administrative elements , sometimes with no substantive content , of various forms of expenditure . 
secondly , transparency with regard to cases and events : whenever the court of auditors refers to specific cases it should identify the institutions involved , thus taking responsibility for the claims that it makes . 
thirdly , thoroughness of analysis : it is incomprehensible that a large number of high quality special reports by the court of auditors are omitted from the annual report in favour of other matters treated without any prior analysis and on the basis of debatable criteria of political timeliness . 
fourthly , accuracy in the use of statistics : statistics can be a valuable tool for analysis but they can also be a dangerous tool for distorting reality . 
using statistics to compare irregularities detected by different institutions as a result of strict or not so strict controls may be more liable to hide what is happening than to expose it . 
high rates of detected irregularities may just as well indicate the zeal of enforcement authorities as suggest corruption in the regulatory system . 
the court of auditors supplies reports and one of the most important recipients of these reports is parliament . 
indeed that is why it says in the report that if it should come to that , parliament must immediately hold a debate on the political consequences thereof . 
amendment no 8, tabled by the liberal group , states that it is important for the committee on constitutional affairs to further elaborate the recommendations of the morgan report so that they can be used . 
mr president , this excellently crafted report shows that the committee on budgetary control can take a coherent and convincing position on such a controversial issue as the importance of budgetary control procedures and bodies . 
budgetary control will always be a tough and thankless business , because it is not a question of handing out compliments but rather of pointing out weaknesses , mistakes and omissions and thereby improving the way the commission handles the european taxpayers ' money . 
in colloquial terms , what this report is saying is that in future the committee on budgetary control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of european tax monies . 
neither the commission nor the member states will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility , certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other . 
point 21 of the report contains a very courageous decision in announcing that the discharge will be postponed if the commission withholds information . 
this declaration of belief in the rights of individual members is particularly important because these are precisely the rights the commission is calling in question . 
it does make us rather apprehensive , commissioner , to find that the commission as guardian of the treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe meps ' rights . 
mr president , i want to thank mrs morgan for her report and to say that i believe it is an important report and good report . 
it has been the product good cooperation at the committee level and i want to acknowledge that mr pomés ruiz and mrs theato made their contribution too . 
this report will go some way towards clarifying the responsibilities that we have and helping the european commission as well to understand what its role is and what is expected of it . 
i would also like to echo the words of mr mulder when he spoke of the importance of the procedure for granting discharge and stressed that it must be taken extremely seriously . 
the people who work on the committee on budgetary control sometimes do not realise the importance of this instrument in guiding the work of the community in so many fields of their responsibility . 
we must pursue this task with firmness but also with moderation and understanding and we must understand that over the year. perhaps because public spending at european level was such a small percentage of the entire public spending of the european union , 1 % as against 40 % on average by the member state. it was seen as a detail . 
they concern a number of courses of action that the budgetary control committee can take when it finds problems in different areas , including recommending to the committee on budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the headings concerned in the following year 's budget ; to authorise no transfers of appropriations to take place involving increasing the headings concerned for a certain period until further internal investigations are concluded ; up to asking the president of the commission to ask for the resignation of any individual commissioners concerned with the serious problems found , a kind of eu caesarean . 
finally , i would commend the rapporteur 's proposals about speeding up the contradictory procedure and the various statements on the special reports , although i do have to say to the rapporteur that i intend to disagree with the five - month timetable proposed in the report for dealing with these . 
perhaps a nine - month timetable would be in order . 
you took a very useful and i believe also a very self - assured step in involving the commission as also the court of auditors in your deliberations before drafting the report . 
those institutions made a targeted effort to find ways of improving the discharge procedure . 
regarding access to documents for the discharge report , which is indeed an important issue , let me point out that the commission 's point of departure in its activities is the interinstitutional agreement reached in july this year , especially annex 3 on access to confidential information . 
i can assure you that the commission will honour this agreement in full . 
let me point out to mrs stauner who just raised certain questions that under this agreement the committee chairperson puts questions regarding confidential information to the commission or forwards them to it . 
let me tell you that the committee chairperson has put no questions on this to the commission . 
the report calls for detailed reviews of operational activities , thorough checks of budget headings and irregularities together with an assessment of the commission 's internal performance . 
we are convinced that with its administrative reform the commission has made and is still making substantial progress here . 
and indeed parliament also paid tribute to this reform programme . 
mrs morgan 's report devotes much space to the question of whether in future the court of auditors should appraise the activities of each directorate - general and each department individually . 
in this context let me remind you that article 276 of the ec treaty refers to the discharge of the budget in general and not to individual parts or areas of the budget . 
in the same context let me observe that of course the risk of errors in implementing the budget regardless of whether they are major or minor ­ differs widely from one department to another because they have totally different operational budgets and face different risks . 
during the general debate it will of course have to be decided whether there will be different levels of tolerance of errors , because naturally it is very much easier to implement the budget in , for example , the administrative sector , where salaries are paid . 
i would say the tolerance of errors should be more or less zero there , while in the area of external services , of foreign policy , quite different risks arise if , for instance , we provide humanitarian aid in a war zone . 
that too would have to be taken into account . 
you can see from what i said that i think it would be useful to discuss these proposals further in order to find out how to assign responsibilities more clearly here . 
after all , that is also what you seek to do in relation to the member states . 
let me point out that i will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the member states ' representatives concerned with financial control . 
and i will happily report back on this discussion to the committee . 
once again , congratulations on your report . 
when a public company is listed , the management and owners are telling the world that investors are free to buy and sell stock in it without the shadow of management or the state rigging the market against them . 
the amendments that our committee is tabling can be grouped into three blocks . 
in the first block are a series of technical amendments that aim to either clarify concepts or fill gaps . 
i am not going to dwell on them . 
in the second block are a series of amendments that aim to improve the participation of workers when there is a takeover bid . 
we cannot close our eyes to reality : when there is a takeover there is staff restructuring , redundancies and so on , in short , measures which affect jobs . 
because if the securities are not traded there , why should they be supervised by that authority ? 
the second controversial amendment refers to the duty of neutrality . 
here we met with very conflicting and even opposed positions , and a formula has been reached that permits some exceptional hypotheses in order to carry out some defensive manoeuvres when it is not possible to call a general meeting . 
my group and i are going to support these amendments . 
mr president , i fear that we are in danger of losing the plot or losing sight of what this directive is about . 
it is part of the financial services action plan ; in our commissioner 's own words , " a key element in the creation of a fully integrated market in financial services , giving investors and consumers more choice " . 
the proposals introduce three key elements at a time when there is a change in control of a company : protection of minority shareholders , transparency in relation to bid information and regulatory supervision of the process . 
but what are we in danger of doing as a parliament , by virtue of the amendments tabled ? 
firstly , we are being far from transparent . 
some of the amendments seem to be a covert attempt to introduce some elements of a company statute through the back door . 
secondly , we are adopting rigid structures and procedures when the recommendation of the commission was actually light - touch , allowing member states leeway to reflect national practice in corporate culture . 
lastly , the issue of clarity : the lack of this is especially evident in the debate about jurisdiction , an issue of which i have a little experience . 
the common position suggested some form of split arrangement . 
now we have a proposition that would lead to muddle , forum shopping , potential litigation at a delicate moment in a corporate deal . 
this is not helpful . 
jurisdiction should be solely in the hands of the member state where the target company is registered . 
but , more than that , the bigger prize is that we are able to take forward the lisbon agenda of creating a competitive , dynamic european economy . 
for that we need an efficient market in goods , services and capital . 
mr bolkestein , i share your concerns : we cannot afford to risk losing this directive , because the eu economy would pay the opportunity cost for years of not being able to restructure european companies . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is very important that after more than ten years of deliberations at eu level the important question of the minimum harmonisation of take - over law can be regulated by a useful framework directive , although , as mr lehne said , the final proposal raises a few technical problems as also problems of content and we assume that unfortunately this proposal can only be improved through the conciliation procedure . 
but it should be pointed out that the situation has definitely changed since the first reading . 
here in the european parliament we are chiefly concerned with finding minimum european rules to regulate the major fields of tension in take - over law , for instance the boards against the shareholders , large shareholders against small ones , companies against the stock market . 
indeed , it has constantly highlighted the need to waste no time in implementing this directive , which is something all interested parties have looked forward to so much . 
the commission has also taken note of the statements brought to the fore by amendments nos 5 and 13 . 
whilst the commission has no objection to these suggestions , it would point out that they do not belong in this directive . 
the current text guarantees employees appropriate information on the conditions and repercussions of the bid . 
stipulations that go further in this area are not in keeping with the objectives of the directive , which relates to the protection of the share holders . 
the labour conditions and employee rights in the event that enterprises are restructured are provided for in other community directives . 
the commission would also like to demonstrate its interest in amendment no 12 . 
this amendment seeks to introduce an instrument enabling a majority shareholder to take over the remaining securities . 
amendments nos 8 and 9 are without foundation . 
after all , it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other , because the various definitions that are currently in use in the member states are all perfectly satisfactory . 
amendment no 17, in its turn , should it be approved , could make it impossible for there to be any kind of hostile takeover bid . 
the commission has no objection to extending the neutrality obligation to after the official deadline of the bid , as proposed in the first paragraph . 
as a matter of principal , a 15 - year time limit is unacceptable in such a rapidly changing world as our own . the industry will change beyond recognition in that time , mainly due to technological progress . 
in addition , setting this type of precedent at a time when the european union is set to double in size would be to give out the wrong signal to candidate states . 
once again , the debate and the upcoming vote will be decided between those wishing to forge ahead with european integration and those who are prepared to let themselves be side - tracked by national interests ( of dubious legitimacy ) rather than the interests of european creative artists . 
it is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand , since this is the only way that the european union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative artists worldwide . 
mr president , commissioner , it is difficult to understand why those who are against harmonising income tax should be in favour of this directive . 
those of us in the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party were very critical at first reading , and we still are . 
we believe that there would be damaging consequences for the european market if this directive were to be implemented before international harmonisation had taken place in this legal area . 
we do not believe that the deadlines for implementation should be shortened in the way proposed by the rapporteur . 
nor do we believe there is proof that national minimum regulations concerning resale right are required in order to improve the internal market . 
as a previous speaker said , flourishing galleries and good systems of grants are important for young artists . 
i will have a hard job persuading the people in my country , but i am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of the right of resale , on the basis of the ep 's proposals , will bring benefits to all concerned . 
i also hope for the commission 's support , at least on one of the three major points of dispute . 
and i am also thinking a step ahead . 
in the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms , we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd . 
collective management firms are not just a kind of collection agency , they are very important partners for the artists of europe when it comes to their rights . 
i put my trust in the wisdom and farsightedness of this house . 
mr president , commissioner , although as i am sure you know i am a friend of european regulations when they are necessary , and against a european bazaar for national special interests , i have promised to put the concerns felt by the platform against the introduction of the right of resale and by the art world before this house , which represents the citizens of europe . 
the right of resale remains as controversial as ever . 
in the end , the issue is the competitiveness of the european art market , which is already finding it hard to fight off foreign competition . 
in my own country , the artists themselves say that they feel they are being forced into this against their will and point to germany , where fewer than 1 % of the 42 000 artists have gained from the right of resale . 
the galleries , which play a crucial part in promoting young artists , are anxious and also oppose the right of resale , since it has to be applied even if a work of art is sold at a loss . 
it is also an issue about the vitality and competitiveness of the european art market . 
if it was centred on berlin i am sure that mr zimmerling would argue quite differently on transposition times and thresholds . 
without an international droit de suite , the fact is that the european art market will go offshore . 
we can also see that the folgerecht does not actually advantage many artists . 
in germany , for example , in 1998, of 7 000 artists who transferred their rights , only 274 actually got any money from it and 40 % of the droit de suite was taken up in costs in levying the sum . 
so there are some problems with how it currently operates . 
i want to use this opportunity to register my dismay that the commission has failed to provide any analysis or evaluation of the economic impact of droit de suite . 
it is far too important a piece of legislation for it not to have done this work . 
i still fail to understand how the commission reached the arbitrary threshold of eur 1 000 with no scientific evidence to back that up . 
therefore i must plead for a long transition period to open serious negotiations on an international droit de suite , without which we will lose the european art market , wherever it is located , whether it be paris , berlin or london . 
furthermore , as experience in france shows , the main beneficiaries are the heirs of dead , rich painters , not poor , living ones . 
at any event , why as a matter of principle should it be right to impose a levy on the sale of a second - hand picture and not to do the same to the maker of a second - hand car or the tailor of a second - hand suit ? 
mr president , i would like to give my response to the comments made and the questions asked . 
the commission welcomes the majority of the amendments proposed by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and congratulates mr zimmerling , the rapporteur , on this dedication to achieving agreement and the way in which he has been able to gain consensus on the most important questions , particularly that of the time limit , which is , in amendments nos 11 and 15, brought down to four years in total , made up of a two - year transitional period and two - year transposition period . 
this seems to be a reasonable period to enable the profession to adapt to the change and for national authorities to introduce the necessary changes in regulations . 
the second important issue is that of the total amount , which is removed in amendment no 7 . 
however , the commission is unable to approve amendment no 4, which relates to the compulsory aspect of the threshold , or amendment no 8, since the distinction made between heirs who are able to benefit from the right of resale is not the same as the concept of ownership of this right and arises solely from national law . 
a similar amendment was rejected at first reading . 
furthermore , the commission cannot accept amendment no 10 for the reason that to draw up and maintain a list of third countries where the right of resale is in force would create practical problems and would not enhance legal security . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take tomorrow at 11.30 a.m . 
( the sitting was closed at 12.15 a.m ) . 
madam president , on a point of order . 
i wish to inform the house of the news of the closure of a car factory in luton in the united kingdom , with the loss of many thousands of jobs . 
i am sure the house will be concerned to hear of this latest example of decline in industry in europe . 
i have duly noted the fact . 
it seems to me an impossible state of affairs when we are debating a very important subject and amendments have come in late , together with those that went to committee , and we do not have them in our mother tongue . 
mr atkins , the services tell me that the delay was only for this week . 
they thought the translations could be made available in spite of this fairly difficult and densely packed timetable . 
nonetheless , i have no doubt that this chamber will have been able to examine each of the amendments in detail and i think it is possible to have the debate on this report . 
in any case , all the translations will be available to meps between now and the time of the vote . 
thus , we propose that the opening should take into account article 16 of the treaty , which raises the provision of traditional postal services to the category of services of general interest , given the place they occupy in the shared values of the union and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion , for which reason they should operate on the basis of principles and conditions that enable them to fulfil their missions . 
without jeopardising the modernisation of all postal services and the opening to competition , member states must continue to preserve their rural network of counter services , which help bring the remote places closer to centres of decision making and are thus indispensable to the social cohesion of the smallest urban or rural communities . 
the committee on legal affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider , but it proposes the same 150 - gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive . 
the difference from the basic report is a simple matter of detail included within the framework of a parliamentary discussion , which , incidentally , has been extremely well conducted by the rapporteur , mr ferber . 
it is also guaranteed that cross - border mail will remain a service reserved for the postal services , and also , if vat comes to be levied on postal services , that the tax should be levied at a reduced rate so as not to raise the price of stamps in the community . 
my committee has clearly rejected the idea of special services , which , as i understand it , were aimed at draining the universal service of any profitable activities , leaving it only with services where costs outweighed prices , and it also made subject to liberalisation the so - called new services , defined as " all those that the universal service provider does not undertake or is not naturally obliged to produce " . 
madam president , there would be much more to say , but i shall confine myself to adding that only rarely has there been such political consensus on an issue among the various committees called upon to express their opinions in this parliament . 
as we have all agreed , it is therefore only right to talk in terms of a universal service , that is to say a service offered to everyone throughout the territory of the european union . 
madam president , i welcome the fact that in committee we managed to achieve a balanced compromise on this issue and i hope that parliament will adopt that position in substance tomorrow . 
in response to mr ferber and his contention that postal companies do not have an obligation to create jobs , i agree with him , but believe that we have a responsibility to create an environment where companies like postal companies can deliver a good , efficient , universal postal service and to ensure that the jobs thereby provided are good - quality jobs . 
that is our responsibility . 
no one is arguing that there should be no change in relation to postal services . 
technology and changing markets will drive change , in any event . 
i agree with the generally declared objective that there should be gradual and controlled change ; but i disagree that the commission 's proposal is in any way controlled or in any way gradual . 
it seems to me that the commission 's proposal goes too far , too quickly , and that , in fact , it would devastate some national universal service providers . 
i know from my own experience in ireland that the irish postal company would indeed be devastated . 
forty - six per cent of its revenue would be opened to competition . 
it would not be able to survive in such an environment , it could not deliver universal services in ireland , it could not maintain the current level of local post offices in ireland as a result of such competition . 
i urge the commission to reconsider its position and accept parliament 's position . 
but , in particular , i urge the member states in council to consider their position ; and i am quite concerned that despite the fact that members of the governing party in ireland are supporting the compromise position here in parliament , the irish government is not supporting that position . 
madam president , commissioner , may i begin by reiterating my thanks to my honourable colleague markus ferber on behalf of our group , because he sought compromises within the committee and he found them . 
you know how difficult this issue is ; it is laden with ideological overtones , sometimes from both sides . 
we therefore owe him our thanks for rallying a large majority behind a sound compromise . 
our group agrees with the commissioner and with the lisbon meeting of the european council , though not that of nice , that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services . 
competition in the postal sector , as it has done elsewhere , will ensure that we have a more effective and an affordable service for consumers . 
however , my group also takes the view that we as a community and as member states must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too . 
at this rate , we will need 100 years to bring about an open market for postal services in europe . 
madam president , i hope that the broader membership of the european parliament will accept the recommendations of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism concerning the future administration of postal services within the european union . 
the opening up of postal services to greater competition is one of the recommendations of the transport committee . 
however , we must recognise that unfettered competition in the area of postal services would result in a severe reduction in the quality of these services in rural and peripheral parts of the european union . 
therefore , it is recommended that universal postal providers within the union will be able to deliver all postal items below 150 grammes in weight . 
this will have the effect of protecting the quality and continued regularity of postal service deliveries . 
private operators will also be able to deliver letters at four times the price of a normal letter . 
we should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive . 
there has been absolute and total consultation between all interested parties in the field of postal services in europe concerning the specific provisions of this directive ; and i am satisfied that these proposals which have come through the transport committee of the european parliament are realistic and pragmatic . 
they will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the european union . 
regular postal deliveries must be seen as an essential economic and social element in rural villages and towns . 
i would be very clear on one particular matter . 
if there is unfettered competition in providing postal services in europe , then lucrative urban areas will be cherry - picked by private operators at the expense of the poorer and less profitable rural parts . 
this is certainly the case within the postal sector . 
backed by a massive lobby , they managed to persuade the majority of this house to adopt an even more conservative stance . 
it is exactly those groups which like to portray themselves as progressive who are putting the brakes on . 
when i then hear that the monopolists are opposed to this idea , it is like asking a turkey how it feels about christmas dinner . 
the monopolists are combing the markets and buying up private companies with funds generated by the monopoly . 
experience in sweden and the netherlands , among others , has taught us that the objections to a free postal market are unfounded . 
there are no remote addresses which are being excluded and employment will recover after the necessary efficiency operations . 
the worst decision which the european parliament could make this week would be to abandon an end date for the second phase . 
if the step which the european parliament now wants to take is far too small , let us then at least ensure that we pick up the thread in a couple of years ' time . 
in a climate of honest competition , monopolists can show what they are made of . 
madam president , i come from the most deregulated country as far as the postal service sector is concerned . 
at the same time , it is the country where the highest number of letters are delivered the day after they have been posted . 
also , no other country in the european union has such fast distribution of post from abroad . 
in the dutch newspapers , mr bolkestein recently criticised the french for adopting a non - liberal attitude , or , at least , that is how the headline in one of the newspapers read . 
by the same token , i could criticise the commissioner for not really applying the dutch consultative model to this situation and for failing to anticipate the social implications which a liberalisation proposal such as this would have . 
after all , you may quote facts and possibly be right in terms of what mr sterckx had in mind , i.e. technological development , the way in which the sector is developing , the role of state companies , the way in which the deutsche post has now taken over dhl , etc. , but this does not mean that you are right . 
i would mention by way of example the time frames of the reform proposal and its entry into force , the fact that we have no knowledge of the effects of the first directive and the attractive , though groundless , observations on the future of the reform , starting with employment and its quality , maintaining an adequate universal service and the impossibility in material terms of accomplishing reform without recourse to a compensation fund . 
spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter , for it established the fund and has used it , and i would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund , the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application . 
moreover , the report does not mention the geomorphologic characteristics of the different countries and the resulting differences in the costs of the universal service even though the categories of users are the same . 
the rapporteur is right , therefore , when he states that the compromise reached is the only compromise possible . 
i personally think that 2007 is much too late . 
madam president , the swedish postal service was completely liberalised as early as 1993 . 
at that time , i was a member of the swedish parliament and was involved in taking that decision . 
the swedish post still has 95 per cent of the market share in sweden . 
in order for private postal deliverers to have a reasonable chance of establishing themselves in the market , it is therefore necessary for them to capture a large share of the market , i.e. for the market to be competitive . 
we in this house must give the postal market a chance . 
these are new times , mr simpson . 
i would like to say : " learn from mr blair " . 
in conclusion , i would like to say that the postal service in sweden has not deteriorated , in some respects it has even improved . 
the costs are not higher than in other countries . 
this translates into longer hours and less job security for the staff . 
it is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund , as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services , will last . 
fledgling companies could in future cite this restriction in their freedom as grounds for filing a complaint on account of improper government intrusion and distortion of competition . 
this is why it is positive that a majority of this house now refuses to take matters as far as commissioner bolkestein proposed at the beginning of this year . 
this has my support , but it would also be preferable if mail between 150 and 350 grammes remained in the hands of the existing postal companies . 
madam president , the postal services in all of our member states fulfil functions way beyond what is purely market activity . 
postal services are of immense socio - economic importance and have always played a key role in social cohesion . 
the current proposals have been the subject of very emotional debate right across the union , particularly in my own rural constituency , and rightly so . 
i represent the constituency of connacht ulster in the west and border counties of ireland , which is predominantly rural and one of the most peripheral regions . 
i hope that , in future , the commission will present to us studies and more comprehensive proposals as alternatives to those which have thus far constrained and limited our debate . 
i will back unconditionally not the compromise , but mr ferber 's recommendations , for i feel that they are the only recommendations possible under the current conditions . 
madam president , we are holding a real parliamentary debate because the positions were initially differing . 
i must congratulate mr ferber and mr simpson on the excellent work they have carried out and which we are able to consider this morning . 
madam president , in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion . 
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the difficulties of finding a compromise have already been mentioned during the course of this debate . 
i am making particular reference to mountainous areas , even though they do not always fall within the definition of rural regions , because , observing the development of the postal system in many european countries , the question of mountains is now one of the most difficult matters to resolve . 
if we were to analyse the data already available to us , we would probably discover that a great deal , hundreds , maybe thousands of post offices have been closed in mountainous areas . 
we have to seek equality of opportunity ; we have to seek a legal framework and a liberalising framework , within which we all have fair and balanced opportunities . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the compromise proposed by mr ferber is an extremely wise one and is inspired by the golden rule that the best is the enemy of the good . 
this compromise , to which mr simpson and other members also contributed seminal work , succeeds in taking into account the fact that , for the entire european field but particularly for the users who live in rural , peripheral , sparsely populated or disadvantaged urban regions , the postal services represent a fundamental link , a fundamental means of connection . 
moreover , the fact cannot be ignored that the sector employs almost two million people . 
it is therefore right to proceed along the road to modernisation and efficiency , and there is no doubt that the liberalisation process which is already underway can also bring these results . 
we want liberalisation but not blind liberalisation . 
the process must continue according to the time frames and procedures which are appropriate to the complexity of the problems and do not affect the area of services of general interest , which are an essential cornerstone of social and territorial cohesion . 
therefore , my advice to you , commissioner , is , to quote a well - known manzionian phrase , ' forward ... but carefully ' . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is as if we are debating the procession of echternach today : two steps forward , one step back with the little progress we are making on one of the key political dossiers for completing the internal market , namely the liberalisation of the postal services . 
the commission proposal provides for gradual further opening and will , in my opinion , surely lead to better services for the consumer at a more competitive price . 
i welcome a review in 2003, but it must lead to the next step : complete liberalisation by 2007 . 
the postal services are ready for it , so is the market , and the customer wants efficient , high - quality and affordable services . 
madam president , i congratulate mr ferber on his report although we have some concerns that it does not go far enough . 
we believe in the need for liberalisation , competition and value for money . 
it is iniquitous that the royal mail in britain is using taxpayers ' money to intervene in continental liberalised markets whilst at the same time fighting to prevent that liberalisation in the united kingdom . 
that is why i have re - tabled some of the amendments which we discussed in committee and which we will be voting fo. especially in relation to the liberalisation of direct mail . 
that is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry . 
we have concerns , also , about the increase back to 150 grammes from the 50 grammes that we believe is necessary . 
we have , alongside this , an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation . 
if it can be done in rural sweden then it can be done in rural britain without any great difficulties . 
sub - post offices closed down . 
prices for posting a letter in sweden are 30 % higher than they are in the united kingdom . 
and if i may now turn to the united kingdom , privatisation of the post office in the uk was blocked because public opinion simply would not tolerate it . 
what i find outrageous is for the commission to propose privatisation through the back door . 
but what is really inexcusable is for the british conservatives to support the european commission 's plans to decimate our postal system in the united kingdom . 
it will be a triple blow to britain and a triple blow in particular to rural britain : an end to the daily delivery and collection ; an end to the uniform pric. people in rural areas will pay more for their post ; and third and finally , an end to our extensive and excellent network of rural sub - post offices . 
i appeal directly to the british conservatives . 
maybe do not listen to us , but listen to the women 's institute in the united kingdom , listen to the council for the protection of rural england , listen even to the countryside alliance . 
all of them are backing mr simpson and opposing your party 's views on this matter . 
i hope that you and your friends can join with labour in standing up for rural britain by opposing the european commission 's plans . 
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who indeed had a difficult task . 
commissioner bolkestein 's proposals were regrettably a bridge too far . 
i certainly recognise that there is nothing wrong with the concept of liberalisation per se and that it can bring benefits to consumers . 
however , it also brings certain obligation. particularly the need to guarantee universality of services . 
this would not have been the case with the original proposals . 
while they would have worked in highly urbanised countries , they spelt disaster for rural countries like ireland . 
in exposing somewhere between 46 and 48 % of the revenue of an post to competition , it would have created serious doubts for the long - term viability of the irish postal service as we know it . 
the cherry - picking that would have ensued would have jeopardised the ability of an post to deliver daily and universally at reasonable cost . 
furthermore , the ability of our national postal service to cross - subsidise our rural post office infrastructure would have been put in serious doubt . 
i therefore welcome the amended report that has emerged from the committee . 
it is indeed a balanced compromise and i hope that it will be accepted by the council . 
let me say this to an post : if this happens , you will have been given a valuable breathing space . 
use it to develop and invest in ireland 's rural post office system . 
there are many possibilities apart from the one - stop shop where all government services are available to the local community , such as e - commerce and the internet . 
at the nice summit itself there were great speeches but , at the end of the day , little was achieved . 
in the same way , the great flights of rhetoric , here in this debate , on the need to build the new europe do little to conceal the faint - heartedness and conservatism that exist . 
all we can now do is hope that , one day , we shall be able to move on from the present stasis and give real impetus to the european project by overcoming the various forms of self - aggrandising corporatism . 
madam president , could i ask mr bolkestein to explain to mr watts the difference between privatisation and liberalisation ? 
mrs peijs , this is not a point of order and this is not the correct moment in the debate to make it . 
commissioner bolkestein has the floor . 
this is not a positive way forward . 
in particular , whereas the heads of state and government at lisbon called for an accelerated market opening , the amendments which i have just now described would result in the opposite , namely a decelerated market opening . 
the two years ' delay in implementing the next step would not be consistent with the current directive . 
the debate about modernising the postal sector started in 1989 during a telecom council at antibes . 
look where we are now , more than ten years later . 
only 3 % of the letter market has been liberalised . 
shifting the next step from 2003 to 2005 would be another delay that , i am afraid , is not acceptable to the commission . 
the degree of market opening as now proposed by parliament would reduce the 20 % of the commission proposals to only 6 % from the start of the year 2005, without any prospect of completion of the internal market in the postal sector and that , i am afraid , does not comply with the conclusions of the european council , nor would it meet the needs and expectations of postal clients , both business users and individual households . 
nor would it meet the interests of the employees in the sector who want to look ahead . 
in short it would be too little , too late , and would bring to a sudden halt the much needed momentum for further change , gravely harming the incumbent adaptation and threatening long - term employment . 
in addition , stopping competition in outgoing cross - border mail would be a retrograde step , difficult to enforce by regulation and leading to complaints from competitors . 
special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged . 
under the existing directive the principle is clear . 
new and distinct services are always outside the reservable area but there is no clear definition of special services in the current directive , and that opens the door to endless debate and market uncertainty . 
it would be unacceptable to allow continuing litigation to determine what happens here . 
we need clearer definitions or else we would fail in our duty as legislators to modernise the regulatory framework . 
i know that modernising the postal services sector is difficult and politically sensitive . 
the post office is close to people , to consumers and to employees alike . 
in this process of modernisation , fear should not be our guide but rather the challenge of improving the sector . 
if we do too little , too late , the postal sector as a whole will be in danger . 
it will be overtaken by technology and ignored by consumers who do not get service for their money . 
i am sure that many of you , and in particular the rapporteur , will agree more than politics perhaps allows you to say . 
all three of these people make important points . 
the postal service is increasingly having to compete in the wider communications market with modern technology developed by the internet , mobile telephones and the integration of different means of communication . 
the traditional post offices with their rigid structure of employment and slow adaptation to market requirements will not be able to compete in those markets if they are held back by parliament 's amendments . 
the monopoly of postal services would cause them to ossify and lose volume which would lead to losses of jobs . 
i am aware of your concern about preserving the universal service and the postal network and i share this concern . 
i stand for cast - iron guarantees that universal service obligations will always be protected . 
regarding amendments nos 60 and 61, i can agree with the principle of completing the internal market at a future date to be determined within a reasonable time frame . 
that is all in line with the commission 's proposal and the conclusions of lisbon . 
however , it will not surprise members of this parliament that the commission cannot accept the remaining proposed amendments . 
commissioner , it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences . 
we in parliament are asking for a transitional period of ten years whereas the commission proposes six ; we are asking for a tariff of " a minimum of eur 300 " whereas the commission says " a maximum of eur 300 " . 
these are differences , it is true , but now we are talking a similar language , which is radically different to the one we have used for years . 
commissioner fischler , i am glad that you have increased your flow of information . 
mr schwaiger said during the previous debate that you should have information which further supplements all the different points of view on the problem . 
this is not the model of development that we europeans want to see . 
some members have expressed their concern about the negative consequences suffered by certain sectors , especially in the united kingdom , as a result of the devious measures applied by the united states , which i believe do not conform to the gatt agreements . 
we believe that the best way to help these companies is to find a way to resolve the conflict as soon as possible . 
therefore , we do not believe it is a good idea to postpone this debate , as certain people have suggested over recent weeks . 
we have achieved a complex and delicate balance on this issue . 
the dary report was adopted unanimously in the committee on agriculture and rural development and also received the unanimous support of the committee on whose behalf i am speaking . 
i believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by mr vatanen does nothing to help this issue , and i would ask him , if he is listening , to consider the possibility of withdrawing it . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr dary , who has given us such a full explanation of the reform , its history and developmen. which i am not going to repeat . 
we are not opposed to the ' tariff only ' system , commissioner , we only wish , given these sudden changes , to take the necessary precautions when it comes to making the leap from one system to another . 
i therefore ask the members of this house to endorse this report in its entirety , as did the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
i am not going to say again that amendments such as the only one tabled by a certain member do not help to achieve this . 
i , like the previous speaker , therefore ask that this amendment be withdrawn . 
mr president , for perplexed observers such as myself , this issue is moving from the bizarre to the surreal . 
we seem to be faced with one series of proposals and counter - proposals after another , dealing with a transitional regime in which the commission first proposes tariff rate quotas based on historical periods , reference periods , but then moves to a ' first - come , first - served ' calculation . 
meanwhile , the us first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods . 
it has become extremely difficult to follow . 
for that reason , amongst many others , i will not comment on the bulk of mr dary 's report but will try and focus on one issue of principle . 
strong forces are lined up against us . 
not only do views differ between states within the european union , which is reflected , as we all know , in the difficulties experienced by the commission in its attempts to come up with a proposal on this matter ; there is also the involvement of the world trade organisation . 
powerful interests are at play , especially those of the americans , who , although they are not banana - growers themselves , have invested american capital in the trading corporations . 
we are familiar with the issues , and our concern that the legitimate interests of the acp countries , of the smaller banana - growers , will fall by the wayside is surely not unwarranted . 
we have tried to table amendments again as compromise motions . 
i hope that the commission will now accept these amendments . 
our main motive in tabling amendment 35 is to ensure that the commission reports to us on the impact of the proposed regime on the interests of the smaller banana - growers and on the acp countries , so that , if there is to be a transition to a ' tariff only ' system , we in parliament shall have a basis on which to make a decision . 
it is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention . 
it is also important to point out that this issue , to my mind , has brought into conflict the interests of a couple of companies , represented by the united states , and those of the european union , which was trying to protect the commitments given to its own farmers , and to the acp countries . 
frankly , i believe that the committee on agriculture and rural development did the best it could , or what was within its power to do , in order to reach an agreement with the commission . 
however , i believe that we can forecast negative effects on the smaller commercial operators and on producers in the acp countries . 
i would like to conclude by congratulating mr dary on his hard work , and the chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development and the coordinators . 
my group will vote in favour of the report in the idea that if we drag this issue out we are going to make it very much worse . 
i conclude by congratulating the rapporteur , mr dary , on the excellent job he has done . 
mr president , the rapporteur deserves thanks and some sympathy for handling this difficult report . 
it is almost impossible to reconcile the conflicting commercial interests and the dispute with the wto , but the rapporteur and the committee chairman have worked hard to produce a report which provides the commission and the council with a more realistic negotiating brief . 
i hope that the commission will respond positively to the amendments , not with the blanket negative view of the last debate , and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns . 
there are already indications that the commission 's first - come - first - served proposals are easing the negotiating process and that past trading volumes may yet be an element in the final outcome . 
the dispute with the wto has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in member states who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors . 
our objective must be to achieve a revised banana regime that will be accepted at the wto and reflect the eu commitment to the acp and the most vulnerable suppliers in the caribbean . 
successive wto rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers . 
the trick is how . 
the commission must demonstrate that their needs will be addressed . 
it is not comfortable to accept the growth of trade liberalisation and a ' tariff only ' system in the future , as the commission has concluded , but it must be faced . 
the higher the tariff that can be negotiated , the less we will need other measures to help the acp and the caribbean . 
i believe that speeding up the negotiations gives the best guarantee of an acceptable tariff level , and for this reason , above all others , i call for full support for this report . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , while the issue of the liberalisation of the postal services has been important , the reform of the com in bananas is no less important . 
i would also like to thank the chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , mr graefe zu baringdorf , for his desire his reach a compromise solution with the commission . 
i would also like to thank the chairmen of the political groups in this parliament who have accepted the stubbornness and obstinacy of the members from the outermost regions so that this proposal for reform of the banana sector may be debated today in this house , and the mandatory opinion may be issued and can thereby arrive in time for the meeting of the council of agriculture ministers which will take place in the coming days and we can therefore enter 2001 with a new reform of the com in bananas . 
hence , the transitional period should be about fifteen years , certainly not less than ten , and the compensatory aid should include guaranteed earnings for community producers and a market for the produce of the outermost regions , and so aid should also be included for the bodies that market the bananas produced there . 
welcome 
ladies and gentlemen , it is my honour to inform you of the presence in the gallery of a delegation from the korean parliament . 
i would like to very warmly welcome this korean delegation , which has come here to attend the sixth interparliamentary meeting between the european parliament and the republic of korea , which takes place in strasbourg on 12 and 13 december . 
it consists of four members of the national assembly of the republic of korea , presided over by the honourable mr jeymoon chung . 
2000 / 0220 ( cns ) ] committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs 
( parliament approved the commission proposal ) 
before the vote : 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 4, 8, 10, 16, 17 and 18 . 
mr president , i should like to take this opportunity to refer to the remarks made by the commissioner at 0.15 this morning and to point out that amendment no 1 imposes an obligation of the commission . 
i am pleased that mr fischler has accepted this amendment , in which the commission is called upon to open international negotiations so that this droit de suite applies not only within the european union but in as many countries of the world as possible . 
in this context , the amendment refers to article 14 of the berne convention . 
in other words , europe could play an exemplary role in this domain . 
( the president declared the common position approved as amended ) 
amendment no 2 : 
mr president , in order not to adopt something that is not true , i would simply ask our colleagues who tabled this amendment to withdraw " denmark " , because denmark has ratified the convention . 
mr president , i should like to inform you that , on 29 september this year , portugal also ratified this treaty unanimously . 
i propose therefore an oral amendment to remove denmark and portugal . 
( parliament accepted the oral amendment ) 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
report ( a5 - 0376 / 2000 ) by ms morgan , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on reform of budgetary control procedures and institutions [ 2000 / 2008 ( ini ) ] 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
explanations of vote - maaten report ( a5 - 0348 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the maaten report approximating the provisions on the sale of tobacco products . 
it is a well - known fact that diseases caused by smoking tobacco reduce the number of pensioners because they reduce life - expectancy . 
i can therefore only support this directive which , although intended to regulate the internal market , also limits or seeks to limit the harm caused by cigarette smoke to the people of the european union . 
i would also add that i support that part of the proposal which calls for harmful tobacco products not to be sold outside the european union . 
it is true that in doing this we would be reducing our production for export , but it is also true that the european union would be acquiring the reputation of selling healthy products , and that can only be a good thing . 
. ( el ) unfortunately , although the commission accepted many of the european parliament 's amendments , the council did not . 
parliament needs to reinstate and re - table most of the amendments on the size of the warning , the list of ingredients and the protection of consumers , especially the young . 
of course , the european parliament must avoid the extremes contained in certain amendments , which are not convincing , do not have a qualified majority and undermine the efficacy of its intervention as a whole . 
of course , if we want to be consistent in our approach , we should put similar warnings on products which are equally harmful to consumers , such as animal fats . 
finally , basic integrity requires that we immediately start putting warnings on cigarettes exported from the european unio. in the language of the importing country . 
i wish to support the decisive decision by the ep to vote for the introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets , this is a huge breakthrough for public health as we now have labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the real cost of smoking . 
existing health warnings are obscured by clever colour combinations , striking packaging and tucked behind careful displays . 
most smokers neither know the full risks nor bear the full costs of their choice . 
-- ( fr ) i have voted in favour of this directive . 
every day , tobacco kills more people . 
might there be two categories of people as far as a number of meps are concerned : those that are to be protected and those that are to be endangered for economic reasons ? 
when i voted against the ban on the advertising of tobacco products in 1998, my vote was misconstrued in letters to the editors of luxembourg newspapers as a vote against the prevention of cancer . 
i tried to explain at the time that the ec treaty provided no legal basis for such an advertising ban . 
the european court of justice has now confirmed that my position was correct . 
members of parliament cannot simply let their hearts rule their heads and adopt legislation for which there is no legal basis , however commendable their motives . 
it is precisely because i do not want this to happen that i have decided to reject the common position , and a motion tabled by my group proposes that the house do likewise . 
the decision made will cost jobs in northern ireland . 
over 95 % of the output of the southampton plant is exported . 
i fear either the company will relocate , or the markets they serve will be met by other suppliers outside the eu . 
so this move will not lead to healthier cigarettes being smoke. but simply to export jobs from europe . 
this is a sad day for the workers in southampton who must now hope the british government might try to block the move . 
i fear they will hope in vain . 
i believe smokers should be given full information but then be free to make their own choice . 
additionally , insisting on imposing our standards outside europe is an example of post - colonial imperialism . 
so i voted for freedo. jobs . 
i wholeheartedly support the common position on the proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the eu . 
we have fought a powerful tobacco lobby to lead the campaign for new cigarette health warnings to cover a third of the surface of cigarette packs . 
smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that . 
half of all long - term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these , half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life . 
as many as half a million people in europe are killed by tobacco , and 85 % of lung cancers are caused by smoking . 
madam president , i would welcome the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health , like they do in canada . 
if shocking pictures of smoke - filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking , go ahead and print them on packs . 
it is preposterous that the tobacco lobby is seeking to destroy this legislation . 
i am fed up of tobacco giants such as marlboro , benson & hedges and rothmans trying to put a stop to these proposals . 
they have misled people for far too long . 
at present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging . 
this is our last - ditch attempt to put labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the true cost of smoking . 
smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice . 
the proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as ' ultra - light ' and ' low tar ' . 
people have been hooked on the idea that ' mild ' and ' low tar ' cigarettes are healthier . 
this is simply not true . 
low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarette. smokers just draw harder to get the same kick . 
this legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives . 
trakatellis report ( a5 - 0377 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the trakatellis report which , as we know , allocates eur 79.1 million for 2001 - 2002, including eur 8.5 million to health information , eur 31.1 million to the plan of action on cancer , eur 22.2 million to the prevention of aids , eur 11.4 million to the prevention of drug dependence , eur 4.4 million to health monitoring and eur 1.3 million to the fight against pollution - related diseases . 
note that these are major programmes aimed at improvements in public health , the fight against cancer , aids prevention , the fight against drug dependence , health monitoring and pollution - related diseases . 
as mentioned in the report , however , it is essential that there should also be an annual extension of the financial appropriation and that the necessary measures should be taken to ensure a problem - free transition while the new programme is drawn up . 
lehne report ( a5 - 0368 / 2000 ) 
mr president , the labour delegation of the european parliament voted against mr lehne 's amendments to the common position . 
as i said in the debate last night , they would be very damaging for eu company competitiveness . 
they introduce rigid structures and try to bring company law in by the back door , which will not achieve a single market in capital and will undermine investor confidence of our shareholders . 
following ten years of negotiation , i regret that this parliament has chosen by a narrow qualified majority vote to allow company boards the right to defensive measures to frustrate takeovers without getting approval from shareholders . 
however , i welcome the fact that the commission cannot go along with the rapporteur 's views on this and i hope that common sense will prevail in conciliation . 
the resale right for the benefit of the author is an important mechanism for supporting artistic creation and artists . 
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7 % . 
however , the attempt to reconcile the resale right with the competitiveness of the european market in objets d ' art has resulted , mainly on the part of the council , in reduced protection for the artist from subsequent sales of his works . 
the european union should move in the opposite direction and help to internationalise the resale right by putting this issue at the top of its agenda during negotiations with other countries with a flourishing art market , such as the usa , switzerland etc . 
if the droit de suite is regarded as part of copyright and hence as an artist 's prerogative , it makes no sense to grant artists a right which they do not want . 
in austria , which is one of the three countries where there is no droit de suite , artists tend to agree that the droit de suite would have distinctly adverse effects , especially on young artists . 
even many established artists , whom it would benefit , have voiced their opposition to its introduction for reasons of professional solidarity . 
besides , it is more than questionable whether there is any identifiable need for harmonisation in this sensitive area . 
the introduction of the droit de suite , indeed , would lead to an erosion of the market in works of art with all its detrimental consequences ; the small galleries , which have a special part to play in encouraging young artistic talent , would come under particular pressure . 
for these reasons , the members representing the freedom alliance have decided not to endorse the report . 
. ( nl ) i would like to thank mr zimmerling for his work on this complicated dossier . 
although it was clear from his report that he got to the bottom of the issue , i as a liberal fail to agree with him , because i believe that , where possible , legislation should be whittled down a minimum . 
in various member states , it has transpired that resale right is superfluous and causes distortions on the internal market . 
this is why i am of the opinion that the international art market will move outside of europe as a result of the directive . 
finally , i believe that the present proposal does not offer any protection to young , fledgling artists in general , but only to a small group . 
by voting against this directive , my group would also like to give out a political signal that we should not waste our time laying down superfluous rules . 
. ( nl ) i would like to thank mr zimmerling for the work he has done on this report . 
although it is an attempt to protect artists , in fact , together with the commission proposal as it is now before us , it has actually achieved the opposite effect . 
of course , i realise that artists are entitled to remuneration for their creativity , but unlike books , in the case of visual arts , this right is actually bought at the initial sale . 
i am concerned for their welfare not only because i have discovered that there is a russian pensioners ' party whose symbol is a heart , a red heart , while the symbol of the european people 's party , which i belong to , is a blue heart . 
there is another reason why i am concerned about the russian pensioners , namely that i feel that the aid which we send to that heavily populated part of the former soviet union which is russia should benefit the russian pensioners and elderly people as well as others and be used to give them a higher standard of living than they had under the communist dictatorship for so many years . 
-- ( fr ) apart from its seeking to make an impact by setting out good intentions regarding stability , the rule of law and the fight against corruption , the oostlander report is in fact nothing more than a vote of confidence in mr putin . 
this document says little or nothing about the disastrous implications of returning to the law of the market : poverty on a massive scale for the majority of the population , whose standard of living has been reduced by two thirds since before 1991 . 
if it is right to denounce the stalinist dictatorship of the past , how is it possible to have the slightest confidence in mr putin , the executioner of the chechen people , the godfather of the various mafias and the man who endeavours to eliminate all opposition in civil society ( unions , political parties ) in order to strengthen his personal power ? 
however , there is absolute silence about the unions , now threatened by the reform of labour legislation and , in certain cases , by outright police repression . 
for these reasons , i have voted against this report . 
baltas report ( a5 - 0364 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the document regulating the republic of croatia 's association with the european union , which is a positive step . 
these stabilisation agreements should all call for and bring about the extension of this regulation which benefits the pensions of those who have worked in these other states . 
-- ( fr ) although the changes in the political situation in croatia can only be cause for rejoicing , the report on a stabilisation and association agreement with the republic of croatia is disappointing in view of the considerable amount that is at stake in this region . 
in general , the financial resources allocated to the stabilisation of this area are widely known to be insufficient . 
indeed , the fact cannot be ignored that the criteria for structural adjustment which accompany aid policies and the conditions for drawing closer to the european union continue , and will continue , to produce social and economic disasters with explosive social consequences and entail the risk , as can now be seen in romania , of the imminent rise of a nationalistic and xenophobic extreme right throughout this region . 
we can , therefore , only condemn the fact that fanjo tudjman was not charged before his death , in the same way as slobodan milosevic , since the newly opened archives prove the extent to which the two men jointly planned the ethnic dismemberment of the region . 
there are major differences as regards the definition of illegal acts and penalties as well as with regard to procedure , rules on evidence and the authority of the prosecuting authority to carry out checks . 
it is to be feared that the problem will become worse with the removal of the borders that has given organised crime even greater freedom of movement . 
the fraudsters will seek out those countries that have the least protection . 
consequently , we must establish the necessary instruments for more effective combating of fraud involving eu funds as soon as possible . 
because of the high incidence of fraud in connection with community resources , we in the freedom alliance have supported tighter controls since time immemorial . 
we therefore welcome the theato report and have voted for the creation of the office of a european public prosecutor . 
our position , however , is that national prosecuting powers must not be affected by the creation of the post of european public prosecutor . 
the creation of this new authority must not lead to any transfer of sovereignty in core areas . 
within these limits , the european public prosecutor , acting as a coordinating authority , can make a valuable contribution to the suppression of fraud . 
-- ( fr ) the theato report on combating fraud reveals that the central european bank , no doubt the better to prove its celebrated independence , thought it inappropriate to subscribe to the interinstitutional agreement relating to olaf . 
thank you , mr crowley , i understand it was a difficult situation . 
that concludes the vote . 
bananas com ( continuation ) 
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the common organisation of the market in the banana sector . 
mr sturdy has the floor . 
mr president , one of the problems with the banana issue , it seems to me , is that it has become rather emotive . 
i see my job as a member of the european parliament as not just to look after those banana producers within the european union but all the people in europe . 
i understand how people feel about changes to the system but , as i said , i want to look after everyone within the european union as a whole . 
if , in that process , i can safeguard the interests of our acp countries then that is all to the good , but i believe that it is important that we safeguard and look to the welfare of european citizens . 
we seem sometimes to have lost sight of this fact . 
i am not one to welcome the way in which the usa has implemented these draconian measures , but it is desperately important that we get a settlement . 
amendments nos 11 and 13 propose that the quota scheme should not be re - examined until ten years have passed and that there should be no commitment now to the tariff system proposed by the commission and demanded by several of our trading partners . 
thank you very much , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , at 10.00 a.m . 
eu / us summit 
the next item is the commission statement on the eu / us summit . 
commissioner patten has the floor . 
mr president , i am pleased to have this opportunity to update parliament on preparations for the eu / us summit in washington next monday . 
good relations between the united states and the european union are , of course , vital for world security and for global economic prosperity . 
the better the relationship , the safer the world and the better off our people . 
today that relationship is in generally good shape . 
europe and the united states work closely together in defence of the values we share . 
we work together , for example , for a liberal , dependable international trading regime under the wto . 
we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of democracy and freedom across the world . 
as in any relationship between friends it is natural that there are occasional disputes , but we should not get these out of proportion . 
on the whole , we have managed recent disputes competently , for example , on the trade side . 
it is important to remember that they represent just a fraction of the total trade that crosses the atlantic . 
the eu / us consultative forum on biotechnology is an example of how to deal with these issues constructively . 
we would like to focus the twice - yearly summits on strategic themes that may run across several summits . 
this is , i acknowledge , easier said than done , but we should try to resist the temptatio. and i know that secretary of state albright shares this vie. for these summits to get excessively entangled in the nitty - gritty of our daily political and economic relationships . 
the commission is currently producing a draft communication on transatlantic relations which we expect to publish in the spring and we will look forward , for example , to the contribution made by those legislators who are part of our transatlantic relationship and parliament will , i know , want to be involved in this initiative . 
we have made some progress in moving things in the direction i describe in recent summits and i hope we will be able to take this forward in washington next week . 
we will , for example , be following up the discussion we launched at cotonou on africa and communicable diseases . 
there are some differences in our approach to these matters , but i hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including tiered pricing . 
we will cover outstanding trade disputes and aim to lay the foundations for wto compatible solutions that are mutually acceptable and not unilateral . 
we expect there to be discussion on a future new wto round as well as some discussion of the implications for that round of the wide array of new bilateral trade initiatives being debated in the american hemisphere . 
i am sure there will be discussion too of other areas where the united states and the european union do not quite see eye - to - eye , for example , on the environment where we must make every effort to support work to salvage a deal on climate change . 
the summit will naturally touch on key areas where the european union and the united states have worked and are working closely together in the service of peace , first , on the balkans where we have had an increasingly close and successful relationship and where , partly thanks to our efforts , there have been so many important changes for the better over the last year . 
we shall , no doubt , review recent developments in the middle east . 
the president and his administration have devoted enormous efforts to the pursuit of lasting peace in the middle east . 
today the dark shadow of violence hangs over the region , but the patient persistent efforts of the peacemakers must continue . 
the european union has a role to play in the process and we are doing that . 
plainly the consolidation of peace will be closely related to the development of our mediterranean partnership . 
one of the main lessons was that the europeans needed to shoulder more of the burden in promoting european security . 
we need to do so , not to decouple the united states from the defence of europe , not because we believe there is any weakening of the us strategic commitment to europe , but to answer those in washington who sometimes call it into question : the voices that claim , with some justification , that europe cannot continue to depend on the united states to bail it out of european conflicts unless it is prepared to do more to help itself . 
he has laid the foundations for a serious and mature dialogue between us in the post - cold - war world and he has worked tirelessly for a cause we all share , that of a europe whole and free and increasingly prosperous . 
equally , we would like to see how the different dialogues of the business dialogue can be put into a broader partnership framework . 
i would ask the commissioner , in the run - up to the release of this document in april , under a new us administration , apparently , it was decided today , under a new us president , hopefully george w. bush , to see how to deepen this partnership in the future , based on the new treaty of nice which extends the activities of the european union so as to enable it to be a real partner with the united states in the decade ahead . 
mr president , commissioner patten , i believe you have given us a good introduction and briefing on the issues and topics that we shall be discussing , and i believe the honourable member , mr elles , was right to emphasise the need to establish precisely what we wish our transatlantic relationship to achieve in the year 2001 and beyond . 
i should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if , besides the analysis requested by the other side of the house , you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domain. in the various dialogues , in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual - recognition agreements . 
that will be very , very important . 
another area relates to the aforementioned eu educational centres , which i believe have been highly successful . 
consolidation is important , but so , too , is the right perspective . 
it is essential that , at future summit meetings , you actually manage to focus attention on the major political issues and that matters such as the trade disputes which highlight differences between us are assigned to their proper place , that their importance is not exaggerated and that they are not allowed to become focal points of political discord between europe and the united states . 
so it will be important to change tack here and write a real transatlantic agenda for the year 2001 . 
i know that our ambassador in washington , gunter burghardt , has already spoken about this , and i should be delighted if his interesting proposals were actually incorporated into your communication . 
i wish you every success in this task . 
i also wish our commissioner , pascal lamy , every success in his efforts to bring about the settlement of our trade disputes with the united states , and it would please me to see you present the communication at the earliest possible date . 
mr president , there seem to be many issues which this summit should address on its agenda , and one that i would like to see there is follow - up to the disappointing breakdown of the climate change talks in the hague and how to get the us to take its responsibilities more seriously . 
but the area that i want to focus on is world trade , the whole idea of a new trade round one year after seattle . 
this would seem an opportune time to take stock . 
i think it is clear that before any new round is considered we need to address the perception of many developing countries that nothing has changed since seattle in spite of the many promises that were made at the time . 
i know the commission is now talking about reviving elements of its position for a new round , making it more flexible , and i look forward to knowing what that really means in practice . 
i also know and welcome the everything but arms initiative and would urge the commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the us again to join in with this initiative . 
but we need to go further in building confidence with poorer countries . 
research from the development agency oxfam has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since seattle with the developing country delegations , the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all . 
bangladesh , for example , says and i quote : " sufficient and sustained efforts have not been made by the developed countries to build our confidence in the wto " . 
lesotho has said : " what has the wto market liberalisation brought to lesotho " ? 
there are very many quotes that i hear from developing country delegations , all of which are saying that nothing much has happened . 
i will conclude with the dominican republic , which says : " the wto was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game . 
it has not turned out that way . 
the rules are biased against the weak and nothing has changed since seattle " . 
the forthcoming summit is the crucial opportunity to address those issues , to change the rules , and to make world trade work for the poor . 
mr president , since i only have one minute , i shall confine myself to a single issue and say that the strengthening of relations between the european union and the united states should not only concern economic and commercial issues . 
it is impossible to remain silent about this state crime , especially when it is committed by the most powerful nation on earth which too often attempts to impose its own order and values on the rest of the planet . 
that particular value , at any event , is one that we do not want . 
it is impossible to accept that the only solution to crime and violence is further crime and violence . 
it is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who , like mumia abu - jamal or leonard pelletier , have sometimes been on death row for years . 
throughout the world , voices are being raised to demand a form of justice which is a genuine reflection of the values of human respect and of the basic rights and freedoms of the individual . 
on every continent , a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people . 
as nicole fontaine rightly reminded us this morning , preserving this most precious commodity called life means , in the end , obtaining a universal moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards its abolition . 
we must defend our political autonomy and stop taking sides with the united states , whether it be in the uno , with regard to iraq or the arab world in general , in asia or in the balkans , where our actions , mr patten , have had disastrous consequences , whatever you may say . 
finally , we should have no problem defending our own economic interests , not only within the wto but , above all , in areas which , from culture to agriculture , are coterminous with european civilisation and must not therefore be subject simply to the laws of the market or of international barter . 
that is what all europeans should be saying if they are concerned to see the type of independent europe which we have portrayed to our compatriots and for which , in reality , we are still waiting . 
mr president , i shall be mercifully brief . 
firstly , in response to mr elles , we should be delighted to provide , as a backdrop to the discussion on the communication we shall produce in the new year on the strengthening of the dialogue between europe and the united states , an analysis of the progress that we have made so far since 1990 . 
we should be delighted to incorporate in that analysis a review of the way that the various dialogues have been developing . 
that is a useful idea and we will certainly follow it up . 
secondly , we will also pursue the very important point mrs mann made on mutual recognition agreements and we should take account of her wise observation that one must not get trade disputes out of proportion . 
i think i am right in saying that eu / us trade amounts to about eur 1billion a day and the total worth of the sanctions applied by the united states against european goods represents about six hours ' worth of trade . 
so , as the honourable member said , we should not get these things out of proportion . 
i was interested by what mrs lucas said about world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that increasingly free trade works in the interests of the poor as well as the better off . 
i know that my colleague commissioner lamy will want to pursue his thoughts and the commission 's latest thoughts on how to revive the wto round with the united states and also with this parliament . 
i know he has a good and very constructive dialogue with parliament and with the committees with an interest in these issues . 
i think mrs boudjenah , who spoke about the death penalty , was probably present in the chamber a few weeks ago when we had an extremely interesting debate on the death penalty , which touched on the situation in the united states , among other countries . 
we take a very clear position on the death penalty around the world , and that relates to our friends in the united states as well as to others elsewhere who may not be quite so well - disposed . 
mr gollnisch and i perhaps look at the world through different spectacles . 
i am not greatly persuaded of the arguments about the devilish hegemonist in washington . 
mr president , in this joint debate we are going to discuss three reports which relate to four commission proposals , which means that i have an unusual number of roles to play . 
the second peculiarity , as you will have the opportunity to discover , is that i am in an unusual position within my own group . 
my military career was neither long nor distinguished , but i did learn that the role of the artillery was to bombard the infantry , if possible , the enemy infantry . 
i will start by discussing the first of the reports , which relates to vat on e - commerce . 
the proposal which the commission has referred to parliament has , in my opinion , a priority objective : to remedy the discriminatory situation currently suffered by european e - commerce companies in comparison to companies from third countries . 
e - commerce refers to the provision of services delivered by internet and radio and tv services provided by subscription or ' pay per view ' . 
i am stressing this because some of the amendments intend to establish a zero rate of vat for services which , in my opinion , are not of an essential or social nature . 
the commission also has other secondary objectives , in accordance with the traditional thinking of ministries of finance : to achieve this objectiv. that of ending this discriminatio. by simplifying the tax , making it considerably more effective in terms of the recovery and reduction of the administrative costs relating to the collection of taxes , to achieve the objectives of efficiency and fairness and to achieve , finally , the modernisation of the tax system . 
these objectives , the main one and the secondary ones , will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the commission must be judged . 
however , mr president , i said that the first of these criteria by which we must judge this proposal is the need to end the discrimination suffered by european companies in comparison with third countries . 
this discrimination comes about because article 9 of the sixth directive establishes the presumption that the place where the service is provided is the address where the service provider is officially established . 
in other words , at the moment european companies are subject to vat when they provide electronic services , whether that be inside or outside the union . 
on the other hand , companies established outside the union never pay vat , whether they are providing services to european clients or to clients in other parts of the world , thereby harming our competitiveness in external markets . 
secondly , the provision of digital products constitutes a provision of services rather than a delivery of goods . 
vat is a tax that was intended to cover the movement of goods and does not suit the provision of services , especially a phenomenon as new as internet services . 
such a proposal is not in line with the principles put forward either by the commission or by parliament for the igc that has just finished . 
there is even less justification for deciding now that it must be so until the end of 2005, when we know that there will be another review of the treaties in the meantime . 
therefore , we also propose removing this requirement for unanimity . 
in conclusion , let us say that we do not like to see the commission giving up completely on vat harmonisation at the beginning of its mandate , and parliament , understanding the need to extend the validity of the legislation in force , being left waiting for the commission , in the middle of its mandate and with the euro already in circulation , to present us with a new , full and thorough proposal on this matter . 
mr president , the first point the committee would like to make is that current arrangements disadvantage eu providers of these services : software , data processing , and computer services , web hosting , web design and information . 
we would like to add educational services to that . 
they disadvantage people inside the eu because they currently pay vat for the supply of these services whereas those outside the european union do not . 
this is why we believe that this directive needs to come into force with some urgency , particularly those of us who believe that there will be a rapid rise in e - commerce . 
the industry committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty - nine votes to three . 
we asked for registration in a single member state . 
we called for the european commission to monitor to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the council and to parliament . 
we asked them to report , in the meantime , on a number of aspects : ensuring equal treatment of companies , looking at the choice of location , harmonising of international regulations and the possibility of establishing a clearing system , as was suggested by the rapporteur . 
there are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context . 
we may have something to learn from america , where they have , of course , imposed a moratorium on such e - tax . 
in short , the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage europe 's e - economy , a right signal would be zero rate vat for our own e - business rather than trying to impose our problems on others . 
mr president , i am speaking in the capacity of draftsman of the opinion of my committee about the taxation of aircraft fuel . 
while road transport pays a hefty fuel tax , commercial aviation is exempt from this . 
the directive concerned provides for the possibility , in future , of amending or abolishing this exemption , based on external costs and environmental damage . 
for the time being , bilateral agreements between member states and third countries are precluding a levy on kerosene for international flights . 
a levy on aviation is of crucial importance , both on account of the ' polluter - pays ' principle and equal competitive conditions for various modes of transport . 
if we are to be able to live up to the requirements for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases we must take every measure possible to limit them . 
mr president , the progress that was made in the domain of european fiscal policy at the eu summit in nice was totally unsatisfactory . 
it is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day . 
perhaps , as a first step , agreement should be reached on a sort of code of conduct to encourage the use of fiscal instruments in the cause of energy saving and environmental protection . 
as far as the vat arrangements applicable to certain services supplied by electronic means are concerned , the commission proposal and the rapporteur merit our support . 
it is unacceptable that european companies should be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non - eu companies in the realm of e - commerce because they are liable for vat in respect of their transactions in the world at large as well as those within the internal market . 
the proposal will put the eu behind in the game and would also be very difficult to control . 
in order to give e - europe a kick - start , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party proposes that the commission 's proposal be rejected and that the member states be given the opportunity to introduce zero rate vat on e - commerce . 
this zero rate vat should apply until the vat rules for non - electronic goods and services have been thoroughly examined and an agreement has been reached within oecd or another international forum on a common position on the taxation of e - commerce . 
mr president , let the experiences from the taxation package serve as an example . 
a global view is required . 
many are in fact asking themselves , commissioner , why europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules ? 
we do not need higher taxes in the eu , instead we need lower taxes . 
mr president , i believe that the successive interventions of our fellow meps in the liberal group show the complexity of the problem . 
it is difficult to understand why the liberals want to do away with tax on e - commerce and to place a tax on the aviation fuel used in aircraft . 
i think it is important to establish some criteria . 
that being said , our collective view is that another tax should be contemplated , other than that relating to fuels , a tax affecting all airlines whenever their planes take off and land at european union airports , so that we can circumvent international regulations and be in a position to tax our competitors too . 
i could say more , for example on the decision to tax the sale of all electronic equipment etc. moreover , this enthusiasm for negligible amounts of taxable income and tax revenue is incomprehensible . 
the commission should rather endeavour to ensure that a common , definitive definition of the e - business taxation criteria reaches the osce or the wto . 
for these reasons we will vote against the report . 
mr president , very few issues among the growing band of united kingdom euro - sceptics excite as much interest as vat , this being one of the concrete examples of the european union interfering in domestic tax matters . 
the tax itself embodies many of the features of the european union which makes it so unloved in my country : it is complicated , bureaucratic , difficult and expensive to administer and , in the uk at least , enforced by a draconian and unpopular inspectorate . 
on parliament 's report , i find myself in complete disagreement with virtually every single word . 
i cannot , for instance , see why the introduction of the euro should require further or even any coordination of vat rates . 
i do not see the introduction of a common system of vat as a priority and i do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue . 
in fact , nothing would please me , my party and the bulk of business people in the united kingdom more than the complete abolition of vat . 
we would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods . 
moreover , we would prefer to determine our own taxes and reject the idea of a common tax system . 
therefore , as to the commission 's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced , i can only express my neutrality . 
we have to appreciate that the people of europe will not strive for greater economic success until hard work and efficiency are properly rewarded again in europe . 
we are familiar with the vital statistics : with taxes and public charges accounting for more than 45 % of earned income , many of our member states have budget deficits , whereas the united states , where taxes and public charges account for less than 30 % of earned income , is achieving budget surpluses of several hundred billion dollars . 
we must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation , not increase it . 
the taxation of aircraft fuel must therefore be rejected . 
the sixth vat directive must be simplified ; if any limit is to be imposed at all on vat rates , it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum . 
in the united states , however , social protection is largely the province of the private sector . 
free - market health care therefore costs the americans the equivalent of 14 % of their gdp , compared with 8 to 9 % in european countries . 
ought not these health care costs in the united states to be added on if tax levels on each side of the atlantic are to be compared ? 
whatever the answer , the point of this digression is to note that solidarity organised via the american budget is thirty times greater than that organised via the community budget . 
unless there is broad community solidarity of a kind which is only possible on the basis of a federal structure that is unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future , the individual states of the european union will be forced to retain control of their taxation . 
in acknowledging this state of affairs , the european union will nonetheless have to , and be able to , fulfil its duty to coordinate taxation in europe . 
coordinating and harmonising are not the same as standardising . 
american local sales tax may vary between zero and ten points , although the difference between neighbouring states is generally no more than five points . 
this clearly demonstrates that europe has no need of uniform vat rates . 
minimum rates , and possibly a maximum rate , are needed , but the states need to be allowed room for manoeuvre to enable them to pursue their own microeconomic policies . 
it is an inappropriate argument and it is not in accordance with european legislation , and furthermore it would do comparative harm to services provided by other means . 
furthermore , it is not true that a moratorium on the taxation of electronic services has been introduced in the united states . 
i personally tabled an amendment on the harmonisation of vat rates , which would correct the effects of unfair competition resulting from third country operators ' power to choose when it comes to registering , since there is a very broad range of vat rates available to the. between 15 and 25. while domestic operators have no choice . 
however , i believe that a better solution has been found to compensate the member states for the loss of vat income resulting from these differences in rates , a solution which i consider to be satisfactory . 
by way of an objection , the group that i represent in this house believes that we should correct the fact that , while newspapers normally enjoy reduced vat rates , this reduction is not applicable to electronic newspapers . 
mr president , the taxation of aircraft fuel really does seem to be long overdue . 
even now , without kerosene duty , the airports in the eu are locked in fierce competition . 
the main reason for this is the fact that different regions have different rules for night flying , a situation which affects cargo transport in particular . 
this puts enormous pressure on airlines to keep their prices down . 
if we were now to go it alone in europe and tax aircraft fuel , european operators would scarcely be able to compete with airlines based outside europe . 
we would destroy our own european market . 
so the taxation of kerosene is only possible on the basis of an international consensus if a level playing - field is to be guaranteed . 
that is not how we are meant to organise society , and that is why i think this proposal is an excellent one . 
mr president , i would like to warmly welcome the report on aviation fuel tax because it addresses head - on the fact that aviation is the fastest - growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and that far from discouraging these emissions , the current exemption of aviation from a fuel tax actually promotes and artificially stimulates the aviation sector and the environmental damage that goes with it . 
i particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that i made in my report for the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism which this parliament voted on a few months ago , namely , that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax , at least in a short term , we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect , including an emissions charge . 
such a charge could be levied on all flights coming into or going out of eu airports , on all carriers , and plenty of research has been done to show that this would not have negative competitive effects . 
it could be agreed very swiftly without requiring international consensus , and could help make significant progress towards internalising environmental costs . 
the importance of moving ahead on this issue swiftly is very clear . 
the forecasts for the global growth of aviation are terrifying . 
official figures suggest a doubling of passenger numbers in just fifteen or twenty years , and if you look at what that means in uk terms alone , in order to meet that scale of demand we would be needing an extra four new heathrow airports or an extra eight new gatwick airports . 
that would clearly be both politically and environmentally unacceptable . 
so , instead of trying to meet projected demand we need to try to manage and reduce that demand by ensuring that the price of aviation more accurately reflects its environmental cost . 
when air tickets are 42 % cheaper today than they were ten years ago , it is clear that the wrong price signals are being given out . 
it makes no sense at all that i can travel from london to brussels return for just £ 89 by virgin airways , for example , yet when i use eurostar , which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel , i have to pay the equivalent of around £ 250 for a similar journey . 
so to conclude , action in this area is overdue and if we do not do something about it very swiftly then our efforts to try to reduce the impacts of climate change are going to be stymied . 
mr president , i wish to address my concerns this afternoon to the proposed taxation on aircraft fuel . 
whilst there is recognition in this report that a kerosene tax cannot be imposed internationally due to the exemption in the chicago convention , nevertheless the introduction of such a tax , intra - eu or bilaterally , would be severely damaging to the united kingdom and the entire european aviation industry . 
not only would our air fares increase dramaticall. possibly by £ 80 per ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carrier. but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers , tourism , businesses and , of course , the freight carrier. they now carry a third of freight world - wide by air . 
it is not true to say that aviation does not bear its costs . 
in fact , the industry pays 100 % of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges , amounting to us $ 4bn in 199. unlike other modes of transport , such as rail and road , which are still heavily subsidised . 
these facts must be recognised . 
in addition , to impose this tax would bring little benefit to the environment , as was proven by the introduction of the air passenger duty tax in the united kingdom . 
aviation is in fact responsible for 2.5 % of co2 emissions world wide . 
other approaches , such as trading and offsets , could be more environmentally - friendly and cost - effective . 
finally , such measures would ruin the competitiveness of the european industry vis - à - vis the rest of the world and would also cause massive job losses . 
so i , for one , will continue to speak up for an industry which is often singled out as the big bad wolf . 
this report is badly crafted on the part of the commission and this parliament . 
there are those , like mr titford , who vigorously defend their own national interest , preferring tax competition to european coordination . 
i am not among these . 
like mr skinner , i think that the proposals from the rapporteur , mr garcía - margallo y marfil , regarding vat on e - commerce are good . 
we do , in fact , think that we must review our tax system in the light of technological developments . 
the current situation is an unfavourable one . 
the facts are that , today , a french person can purchase software from an american company exempt from vat , whereas an american making a similar acquisition from a french company is taxed at the rate current in france . 
i see this as a double competitive advantage for the american company . 
i am not sure that this is the best way of supporting our own e - commerce industry . 
mr president , i should like to express my thanks to mr garcía - margallo y marfil for his work . 
i only intend to speak about the taxation of aviation fuel . 
parallel to this debate , we have been holding talks with mr currie , the director - general for environmental affairs , on the outcome of the negotiations in the hague . 
in this context , i am sorry to say that aircraft emissions do pose a problem ; although air traffic is not responsible for a large percentage of pollutant emissions , its volume is growing very rapidly , and we must therefore avoid any temptation to trivialise it . 
but we must also reach an agreement , because there are widely differing views here in the house about the method we should use to tackle this problem . 
i believe we all agree that it would be very difficult indeed to find a global solution but that a global solution represents the ideal outcome . 
there are now som. and they include a majority of the committe. who say they want a european tax , to which the rapporteur has rightly replied that such a tax could only cover a tiny percentage of the world 's air traffic and , more crucially , that it would create a huge problem for european industry . 
to that end , the proposal for emission - based take - off and landing fees ought to be seriously examined , because it offers a means of including aircraft from other parts of the world , such as the united states and japan , in the taxation regime when they land in amsterdam , london , paris or frankfurt and thus of achieving greater environmental benefit and less distortion of competition . 
there might be problems with the wto , but i believe it is up to the commission to seek a solution at the wto negotiations , a solution which is compatible with the wto rules and which our trading partners might be persuaded to accept . 
mr president , i find the idea of a unilateral setting of eu aircraft fuel tax regimes entirely inappropriate , given that globally we are still subject to the chicago convention of 1944, exempting kerosene from taxation internationally . 
european aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra - eu as opposed to intercontinental fare structures . 
while the expansion of air traffic and the environmental problems of global warming and pollution are serious and important issues , i feel that a more effective approach would be to tackle this within an international framework . 
by focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the eu , we risk harming our industry without achieving much - needed progress in lowering emissions . 
this same problem of trying to impose a regional solution to a global question arises with the difficult issue of vat on digital electronic services . 
to levy vat on third - country suppliers , largely american , is not only impractical but , in the case of newspapers and books , it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop . 
it is also inherently neither enforceable nor collectable , unless regulated internationally , as undoubtedly servers would be set up offshore beyond the eu 's jurisdiction . 
the scheme will be harmful to the development of smes , both within and outside the union , especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of eur 40 000 annual turnover . 
i personally advocate a vat zero rating of all digital services until international agreement is finally reached . 
finally , the torres marques report on a minimum standard rate for vat represents tax harmonisation by the back door and threatens the uk 's zero rates on children 's clothes , food and newspapers . 
as a british conservative , i can only regret the high indirect tax rates throughout the european union and i hope that by promoting tax competition we may bring pressure on our labour government to lower them in the united kingdom . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my honourable colleague mr goebbels referred to the feira agreement , of which he takes a dim view . 
i therefore support those who want to totally exempt european companies from tax on electronic products , for the present at least . 
neither do i really understand the argument that products that are supplied electronically should be treated in just the same way as traditional products . 
mrs randzio - plath , for example , said this . 
in my opinion , reading the morning paper in a street café is quite different from reading it on the internet where you work . 
we are talking about a different product . 
mr president , i would like to start by commenting on the levy of vat on electronic services . 
the guiding principle that suppliers from outside the community who supply to customers within the community need only register at one location must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between the member states . 
measures should be taken to avoid this . 
there is general consensus that a solution must be found whereby suppliers from outside the community need only register at one location , and this is an absolute necessity in the eyes of the commission . 
i would like to briefly comment on the further detailing of this solution . 
i am of the opinion that this idea can be combined with the original commission proposal for one single registration without putting up bureaucratic barriers for industry . 
i would like to stress that we are talking about a system of reallocation of revenue and not about the distribution of this revenue . 
the system of reallocation of revenue will need to be carefully worked out . 
it is useful to have an objective and clear criterion at our disposal , namely the member state where the consumer lives . 
this rules out the complexities which would emerge if macroeconomic or similar criteria were to be applied . 
although i do not foresee any insurmountable technical hitches , a great deal of time will need to be invested in the next couple of months in the further development of the system , particularly with respect to the legal basis , so as to enable tax to be levied on all member states by means of one declaration . 
as usual , we need to ensure that the solution we opt for does not give cause for concern outside the community with regard to discrimination against suppliers who are not based in the community . 
in this context , i believe that the council should revisit the issue of threshold amounts for registration and look at whether a fair solution can be found . 
vat is a general consumer tax . 
there are few exemptions from vat and where these have been introduced , this was generally for cultural or social reasons . 
this is a simplification measure which regulates the exchange of information between the member states on vat numbers in the electronic trade , and we will take the proposal to heart in our future work in parliament and the council . 
allow me now to turn to the proposal on the minimum level of the normal rate . 
despite the efforts made by this parliament and the commission , as referred to by the rapporteur in his report , little progress has been made so far on the activities to replace the present vat transitional regulation by a final regulation based on tax in the country of origin . 
however , it should also be pointed out that the current climate , where the conditions are not favourable for achieving further harmonisation of vat rates in the short term , makes meaningful progress in the near future very unlikely . 
consequently , without prejudicing the idea of a definitive system but with a view to improving the working of the internal market in the short term , the commission has drawn up a new vat strategy which comprises four key goals , namely the simplification and modernisation of the existing rules , more uniform application of the present provisions and stricter implementation of administrative cooperation . 
it is in the light of this that this proposal is seeking to maintain the existing level of harmonisation in the field of vat rates by confirming the minimum level of 15 % for the normal rate . 
the proposed five - year period reflects the stability which the new vat strategy stands for , and reducing this period to three years , as proposed by the rapporteur , seems too short to enable the commission to meet its obligations . 
this communication took into account the conclusions of an exhaustive study . the upshot of this study was that the environmental effects and the implications for tax revenue and other effects mainly depend on two factors , namely the level and scope of the tax . 
the suggestion to extend the scope of excise on mineral oils to include aircraft fuel and thus to end the existing inequality in treatment with regard to different modes of transport has met with strong support . 
furthermore , this approach was generally well - received during the discussions which were held within the council . 
the recommendation that future discussions must take place within the framework of the international civil aviation organisation , the icao , namely during its 33rd general meeting in september and october of the year 2001, also met with the same level of support . 
these discussions will prove very difficult , however , since the possibility of levying tax on aircraft fuel was not decided on at the previous general meeting . 
accordingly , no major groundwork has been done within the icao working parties and it is unlikely that the chicago convention will be re - negotiated at the forthcoming general meeting . 
despite this , the community could urgently request the review of the existing icao provisions concerning tax on aircraft fuel to be included in the working programme of that organisation and to underline the anticipated positive environmental effects of such a measure vis - à - vis other icao members . 
a resolution issued by the general meeting of the icao which paves the way for an internal solution to the issue of tax on aircraft fuel or the use of other instruments with equivalent effects would be a crucial first step in the right direction . 
for the first time there has been awareness of the need to find european solutions to this type of issue related to maritime pollution . 
it is obvious that one state of the union on its own cannot have any real influence on maritime transport across the world and , on the other hand , the international maritime organisation is too slow and lacks effective means to adequately monitor the rules which it lays down . 
the european public has insisted that the european institutions should adopt quick and drastic measures to put an end to the scandal of flags of convenience . 
i sincerely believe that , given the progress that has been made quickly in the work of our respective bodies , it is undeniable that all the institutions have understood and fully accepted the importance of this issue . 
for its part , just three months after the accident , the commission assumed its responsibilities and adopted a first package of measures , which the european parliament approved fully on 30 november . 
in this respect , i would like today to very briefly present the content of this new package known as erika ii . 
firstly , we will be implementing a european system of maritime transport inspection . 
as such , the first measure is a proposal for a directive establishing a european system for monitoring , inspection and information with regard to maritime traffic . 
at the same time , we will be approaching the international bodies in order to try to review in detail the system established by the international agreements . 
in the event that the imo does not adopt the necessary measures , the commission would submit a proposal to parliament and the council on a community system for responsibility and compensation in the event of pollution by hydrocarbons . 
furthermore , any person who has contributed through serious negligence to causing pollution will be subject to deterrent penalties , which will serve to promote responsible behaviour on the part of the maritime industry as a whole . 
in fact , with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force , it is crucial that we standardise practices and exercise greater control over the implementation of community rules , in order to prevent significant and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety which could arise within the union . 
the european maritime safety agency constitutes a first stage in the increasing integration of the administrative practices of the member states , which may one day lead to the creation , as has been repeatedly requested by this house , of a genuine european coastguard organisation . 
however , ladies and gentlemen , we have not reached that stage yet . 
mr president , i hope that parliament will take this opportunity , on this highly symbolic dat. the first anniversary of the erika disaste. to remember its determination and give the commission the support that it will need throughout the legislative process . 
mr president , madam vice - president , may i congratulate you once again for having outlined the erika ii package in clear and comprehensible terms and especially the need for us to inspect vessels in transi. subject to the international law of the se. rather than only checking vessels that dock in eu ports . 
these other ships which are only passing through eu waters can cause equally bad and even far worse pollution of our shorelines . 
so i believe this approach is absolutely correct . 
as far as liability is concerned , we must take a very careful look at that . 
the oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund . 
this raises the question of whether we need a public fund . 
unless this happens , the council will bear a degree of responsibility , or rather a great deal of responsibility , for this delay and the ministers will have to explain themselves to the public . 
mr watts , firstly , i would like to thank you for your vote of confidence and , secondly , i would like to point out to you that we have included the issue of the black box , thereby fulfilling the commitment we gave you . 
with regard to the black box , it should be pointed out that the international maritime organisation has laid down an obligation of this type for ships using national routes as from july 2008 and we wish this date to be brought forward . 
i hope that after the impetus provided in nice , the doubts and resistance of certain countries will have been reduced and that we achieve this . 
in relation to the fund , i would like very briefly to mention two issues : blacklisted ships and flags of convenience . 
even the countries which have a lesser degree of safety with regard to their ships have some ships which are safe ; therefore , in accordance with international laws , we cannot exclude them a priori . 
what we can do is what we have indicated , that is to say , that if a ship belongs to one of those countries which has unsafe ships , not only countries with a flags of convenience , but also those which show little concern for safety in particular , it should be systematically inspected when it reaches a european port . 
mr president , the commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the uk government on 8 november 2000 was the introduction of some form of road - user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers , british and non - british alike , for their use of the road network in the uk . 
the commission sees , therefore , no indication that the announced measure introduces direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the haulier or the origin or destination of the vehicle . 
provided that the implementation aspects of the charge in question do not introduce indirect discrimination either and they respect all other relevant specific rules governing the introduction of user charges in the european union , such a charge seems at this stage to be in line with current community law , that is directive 1999 / 62 / ec . 
this directive , adopted by unanimity in 1993, laid down the conditions under which member states could , if they wanted , apply time - related user charges or motorway tolls . 
the overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the eu internal market . 
twelve of the 15 member states have already adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis put on direct charging , user charges or motorway tolls and less on taxes . 
the commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network . 
subsequently i asked the commission if it was aware of this . 
that was changed in the face of criticism , especially from ireland and france , and a different spin has now been put on it by the british chancellor of the exchequer : it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all , including british lorry drivers . 
i am sure in an election year in britain their own lorry drivers would be interested to know that they have an extra £ 1 500 a year to pay on top of their taxes . 
mr president , given the evolution of the situation within the european community , the commission is writing to third countries drawing their attention to the measures taken in relation to bse within the european union and alerting them to the need to consider similar measures . 
in addition , the scientific steering committee is carrying out an assessment of the geographical bse risk of individual third countries , on which the results are expected in the first half of 2001 . 
policy towards imports from third countries will be decided in the light of this assessment . 
i have recently visited poland , hungary and the czech republic where i have underlined the necessity to be vigilant in regard to the risk of bse . 
i am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available , whether it comes from within or outside the european union , meets the highest standards . 
will the commission therefore please tell me : how it views these texts , which are worthy of mein kampf , whether it intends in the future to make aid conditional on respect for fundamental human rights , and whether it intends to condemn the indoctrination and exploitation of children in the israelo - palestinian conflict ? 
naturally i understand the honourable member 's concern . 
as far as the commission is concerned , we have never supported financially the production or distribution of school textbooks nor the preparation of school curricula . 
assistance to the educational system is focused mainly on infrastructure , equipment for schools and direct assistance for school expenses , for example , salaries . 
those are a few passages from the palestinian schoolbooks used to teach children in the territories , an education service , moreover , which we ourselves are funding to a large extent . 
as you said , commissioner , particularly where wages are concerned , the european union is funding a form of education which is , in reality , being twisted into anti - semitic propaganda . 
i also asked you how the commission might monitor this aid , and you did not reply to me on this point because there is in fact no real monitoring . 
that starts with the young people . 
the commission services are informed by texaco and chevron that their announced merger would fulfil the turnover criteria of the european merger regulation . 
texaco and chevron have therefore entered into pre - notification discussions with the commission 's merger task force . 
following notification , the commission will have to assess , in view of the legal test in the merger regulation whether the operation will lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position , as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it . 
the commission 's assessment under the merger regulation can therefore only take into account competition concerns that affect european companies and citizens . 
the merger regulation provides no legal basis to take allegations of human rights abuses into account and the commission therefore has no powers to investigate such alleged abuses in this context . 
let me say about texaco that the centre for economic and social rights says that in ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates . 
they have been accused by ecuador 's own national oil company of dominating indigenous peoples . 
in nigeria , chevron has been accused by the all - ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the warri naval base . 
whatever you say about the legal base and concern over competition policy , the public in europe is concerned about such abuses of human rights . 
if you are not willing to act now , i suggest that you signpost how other action could be taken by your colleagues in the commission against abuses of human rights which are unacceptable to all of us . 
i can assure mr howitt that the commission , individual commissioners and i personally , are very concerned about all issues pertaining to possible abuses of human rights . 
having said that , there are , of course , different instruments for different purposes , and in the community legal order , the merger regulation has the very limited , and yet important enough , objective of ensuring the protection of competition in the interests ultimately of consumers on the occasion of mergers . 
i do not believe that it would be appropriate to aim at more than one objective through a single instrument . 
the merger regulation is a powerful tool to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected when companies combine their activities . 
its efficiency should therefore not be hindered by adding other objectives of a complex nature that are difficult to assess and that would at any rate not be effectively served by this specific legal instrument . 
conversely , member states and the european union have at their disposal other means to deal with human - rights - related issues . 
question no 37 by ( h - 0900 / 00 ) 
subject : shipbuildingon 15 november the commission published its third report on the state of shipbuilding in the world . 
the report concludes , inter alia , that the aid received by our industry has not solved the korean issue . 
does the commission believe that without this aid the european shipbuilding industry would have withstood unfair competition from korea ? 
how does it intend to guarantee the survival of what remains of the industry from january 2001 onwards in the face of unfair competition from korea , further evidence of which is contained in its latest report ? 
in its report adopted on 15 november the commission concluded that operating aid under regulation 1540 / 98 has not provided a solution to the problem of south korean pricing practices . 
however , among the various actions proposed , it committed itself to examine as soon as possible the possibilities to propose measures to address the korean problem in accordance with the regulation . 
at its meeting of 29 november , the commission reaffirmed that it is against any prolongation of operating aid . 
however , it indicated that it is ready to explore the possibilities for greater use of national support for research and development , including appropriate changes to regulation 1540 / 98 . 
the commission also recalled that substantial funding for research and development is available under the community research framework programme . 
as regards trade actions , on 2 december the commission published its decision to open an investigation following industry 's complaint under the trade barriers regulation ( tbr ) . 
in the context of this tbr procedure , the commission can decide to resort to wto dispute settlement procedure unless a mutually satisfactory solution is agreed with the authorities of the republic of korea . 
the final investigation report will be transmitted to member states by april 2001 . 
in addition , if in the framework of the tbr procedure the commission does not achieve a negotiated solution with korea satisfactory for the european union , the commission will report to the council by 1 may 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the wto in order to seek remedy against unfair korean practices . 
in addition , the commission will , at the same time , propose a defensive temporary support mechanism , specifically designed to counter unfair korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the wto procedure . 
this mechanism will be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that eu industry has been directly injured by unfair korean trade practices . 
on a multilateral level , the commission will pursue its efforts to establish a level international playing field for the shipbuilding industry within the oecd . 
the commission 's position was presented to the industry council on 5 december and the council welcomed the commission 's determination to tackle the problem of unfair korean competition and took note of the commission 's proposals in this regard . 
commissioner , firstly , to a certain extent i feel reassured because i notice that the commission has been concerned with , and has perhaps also done something about , this problem . 
i believe that the intentions as a whole are hugely reassuring , but the reality is that meanwhile our dockyards are closing down . 
i come from a country , spain , and specifically the basque country , where there is nobody left building ships because we cannot cope with korean competition . 
the korean shipbuilders are quite happy to carry out dumpin. not only with regard to the european union , but also the whole worl. and i cannot see any solution to it . 
i would be grateful if we could take immediate and crucial measures . 
commissioner , you know that unfair competition on the part of korea has been proven . 
the commission has been there and has seen it . 
we are now facing a long process . 
we will possibly have to wait half a year to know whether or not the world trade organisation will condemn the unfair competition of the koreans . 
and we must not forget that mr valdivielso de cué asked you if the commission believed that , without the aid which the shipbuilding industry had received , this industry would have been able to survive in the european union . 
this is a dramatic issue . 
that is the question : is the commission prepared to prolong certain aid , at least in the case of the most needy regions that have a major shipbuilding tradition , so that they can survive in the face of this unfair competition ? 
the commission report has established that , as operating aid has not been helpful in solving the problems created by unfair korean competition , we decided not to prolong those operating aids . 
at the same time it was decided that mr lamy should in further negotiations and actions vis - à - vis korea , have the most powerful and focussed instruments . 
we believe that would not be represented by an across - the - board continuation of the existing operating aid but rather by the commission being prepared to come up with a focused and specific instrument in the event of the actions undertaken by commissioner lamy on behalf of the commission not being successful for the european union industry . 
second partquestions to mr lamy 
question no 38 by ( h - 0868 / 00 ) 
subject : anti - dumping duty on import of coke of coal in pieceseuropean foundries and the insulation industry are using coke over 80 mm in diameter and are employing more than 100 000 people within the community , while community producers of coke employ no more than 800 people . 
does the commission find it in the interest of the community to protect the eu coke industry , which has already benefited from substantial price increases , and thereby seriously harm the user industries which employ substantially more people ? 
how does the commission expect the user industry to remain competitive in the face of competition from iron castings from the far east when the user industry has little or no possibility of increasing its prices ? 
in the light of the foregoing , an increase of imports of coke can be expected from third countries leading to higher emissions of sulphuric acid . 
if so , is the commission 's decision in conformity with the community 's energy and environmental policies ? 
on this issue of coke imports , i should like to begin by emphasising that the commission services hav. as is only righ. undertaken a very thorough analysis of dumping on the part of the chinese , the resultant harm caused to european industry and the possible consequences for users of the coke . 
as a result of the investigations , it was concluded that there is no doubt about the dumping and the damage it causes and that the effect of the anti - dumping measures on the user industries would be limited . 
particular attention has been paid to the issue of employment . 
coke - using industry employs a total of 70 000 people , but this product represents only a very marginal portion of its costs , in the region of 2 % . 
it has also been established that the coke - using industry was able to pass on a moderate increase in its prices to its clients . 
there are therefore unlikely to be harmful effects on employment and competition in the coke - using industry . 
question no 40 by ( h - 0889 / 00 ) 
subject : market access for less developed and developing countriesdoes the commission intend to honour its obligation under the cotonou agreement to consult acp countries , and undertake country and sector specific impact studies , before the council takes a decision on the commission 's proposals to grant duty - free and quota - free access to the european market for all products , except armaments , from the world 's 48 least developed or developing countries ? 
i shall answer both questions at the same time . 
this proposal , which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the community in favour of least and less developed countries , is aimed at promoting the integration of these countries into the world economy . 
we think that it is , indeed , imperative that the process of globalisation should not cause the poorest developing countries to become marginalised . 
this initiative is based upon a council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current gsp . 
i entirely agree that this proposal is an important decision which should be subject to the codecision procedure . 
that is what the commission proposed to the intergovernmental conference . 
what they feel , commissioner , is that cotonou was very carefully negotiated by the acp and that within five months , almost before the ink is dry , there are proposals without any consultation . 
of course , you had consultation after the event , but not before , which is part of the agreement under cotonou , as you know , as is the need for joint impact studies to be undertaken . 
in fact , it is a question of authorising access to greater quantities which are small as far as we are concerned , and therefore not destabilising , but which represent large amounts for these countries , given the size of their economies . 
the initiative is not therefore of a kind which will destabilise the highly protected community sugar market . 
if need be , we shall include the necessary precautions in the amendments we are working on . 
we are in fact working on a number of amendments with a view to making this proposal acceptable both to the council and to parliament . 
let us have no illusions : given the state of the economies concerned , it is difficult to devise models for their ability to respond on these matters . however , the impact assessment will be made available . 
these funds can be allocated by means of the commitment appropriation under budget item b7 - 663 in the budget for the year 2000 . 
one of the four organisations is ecpat , whose measures in this area during 2001, which are eligible for aid , are wholly covered by this application . 
the commission 's procedure for granting the desired financial support will soon be complete , and this also includes the funds which ecpat requires for 2001 . 
as from 2001 it is the commission 's intention to finance actions against sex tourism by implementing the on - going programmes against child sex tourism . 
we have three types of activities in this area . 
the second area is technology . 
we need technology , for instance to enable parents who want to filter the content of the internet to do so . 
we have had a particular project for that . 
the third area has been particular actions like hotlines . 
i will discuss that issue with my services once the budget resources for next year are clear . 
i will be happy to come back to mr rübig after that . 
questions to mr bolkestein 
question no 44 by ( h - 0872 / 00 ) 
subject : european patents courtwhat is the present stage in preparations for establishing a european patents court , and how does the commission assess the proposed site of munich ? 
i should like to point out that munich is situated in the heart of europe and is also very accessible . 
i am aware that munich has seen major economic activity in the field of patents . 
this is why the patent office is based in munich . 
however , i am of the opinion that it is premature at this stage to enter into a discussion as to where the future community patent tribunal should be based . 
at present , the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have . 
indeed , we intend to ensure that the centralised jurisdiction is near to all members of the judiciary across the community . 
i would like to add that it is difficult to have a community or centralised patent without centralised jurisdiction . 
because if that was not the case , this would mean that there would be a tribunal in all member states of the european union for administering justice on patent infringement procedures , and that could mean that a german company could find itself in a tribunal in country x , far removed from the registered office of that company , and with enlargement in the offing , that could imply far greater distances still . 
it is essential that one judicial body be put in place , both in first instance and in appeal , where patent disputes are settled . 
as mr bolkestein is aware , members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , including myself , have expressed a certain concern in our previous dialogue about the risk of a proliferation of community jurisdictions running alongside and in parallel with those of the members . 
hitherto the main thrust has been one whereby litigation is primarily focused in member state courts but problems of interpretation of community law are centralised in the sense of references to the court . 
that has been a way of ensuring that the law is consistent throughout the union and yet is locally administered . 
i would like to be assured that the commission will consider very carefully the virtues of such an approach , because i suspect a proliferation of jurisdictions may , in the end , fragment our legal systems . 
i am not sure what the honourable member means by the word ' proliferation ' . 
does he mean a geographical proliferation or a functional proliferation , according to various subject matters ? 
if mr maccormick means a functional proliferation of courts of justice , i can see his point of view . 
i understand that his concern is that there should not be a proliferation of special tribunals dealing with this , that and the other . 
that is certainly an understandable point of view , which i share . 
however , patents , represent very specialised work . 
just as the law courts in düsseldorf , munich and elsewhere in germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in london , a community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning community patents would have to be very specialised . 
it is not work that could be given to a new judg. if i may put it that wa. even though that judge might be very experienced in other fields . 
this is why the commission contacted the member states concerned prior to sending the reminder . 
those contacts have been successful to the extent that , over the past year , another three member states have submitted their lists with courts of first and second instance for the community trade mark . 
despite this , we are of the opinion that the situation , which has admittedly improved but is still unsatisfactory , cannot continue any longer . 
accordingly , the commission will take all measures which it deems necessary . 
paragraph 5 of article 91 of the community trade mark regulation stipulates that , as long as a member state has not notified the commission which courts of first and second instance are authorised , each procedure must be instituted at the judicial body of that member state which is given absolute or relative powers . 
to prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one , on 13 july of last year , the commission reminded the member states concerned in a letter , of their obligation to designate courts for the community trade mark . 
since then , those countries have still not notified the commission that they have taken steps . 
the commission would like to inform the honourable member that a complaint is pending regarding the thessaloniki underground rail project . 
the plaintiff claims that community provisions have been violated with regard to state support and public contracts . 
as the honourable member of your house is aware , the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project . 
the commission is of the opinion that questions regarding delays in the execution of the project must be put to the competent greek authorities . 
as far as those aspects of the case which pertain to provisions on public contracts are concerned , the services of the commission have made their position clear to the plaintiff in a letter which will be sent in the next couple of days . 
accordingly , we are unable to provide the honourable member with the information requested at this moment in time . 
also , the commission has assessed whether the funding of the project can be reconciled with the rules of the treaty in terms of state support and has not reached a verdict yet . 
in broader terms , the commission would like to make the honourable member aware of the fact that a complaint of such complexity must be investigated very carefully indeed . 
furthermore , the aspects of the case regarding state support cannot be investigated by the commission before the financial side of the agreement has been completed . 
in this context , i would also like to point out that the plaintiff , from the time that the franchise agreement was made public in greece , has taken eight months to make up his own mind and lodge his complaint with the commission . 
it is obvious that the commission respects this principle . 
having said this , pursuant to the same regulation , member states need to take all necessary and proportionate measures to restore the free movement of goods on their territory as soon as possible so as to avoid serious disruptions to the free movement of goods when a restriction as defined in the regulation has occurred in the context of a strike or similar action . 
furthermore , member states must notify the commission of any restriction occurring on their territory and of the action undertaken by them . 
the principles which i have outlined apply to all questions raised by mr sjöstedt . 
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply . 
it was a fine clarification of the reply i received earlier . 
as i understand it , the commission guarantees that it neither will , nor can , intervene in legal trade conflicts even if they restrict free movement . 
if this is the case , then i thank you for that . 
i can only reiterate what i said a moment ago . 
it is up to the member state to decide whether a strike is legal . 
in the case of diplomas awarded by british universities in the context of a franchise agreement with a greek study centre , the validity is established on the basis of the rules which apply in the member state in which the university which has concluded the agreement is based , the united kingdom in this case . 
awarding a diploma in this way does not contravene uk legislation and can thus be deemed legal . 
the diploma is then british . 
directive 89 / 48 / eec pertains to higher - education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years ' duration . 
diplomas of a lower level fall within the scope of directive 92 / 51 / eec , and these directives apply irrespective of whether the diploma has been awarded on completion of a course at the university itself or at a study centre which has signed a franchise agreement with said university . 
the directives apply to professions which do not fall within one particular directive . 
the principles which i have explained here apply equally to all member states or in all member states of the european union . 
i should like to thank the commissioner for attempting to answer my question , but i should point out that students in greece are currently somewhat confused because the free study centres are claiming that they are able to issue study diplomas which qualify for recognition under directive 89 / 48 / eec , if , and provided that , the course in question is completed in britain , while the greek authorities and the competent bodies are refusing to recognise diplomas issued for courses completed in britain . 
it looks pretty much to me , at the moment , as if the commission is washing its hands like pontius pilate . 
the question is : who should these students apply to in order to confirm that , if they take these courses and complete their studies in britain , they are entitled to have results ? 
president , may i first of all say that the commission has no desire to play the role of pontius pilate , in particular because of the sequel to what pontius pilate did , so i hope that the honourable member of this parliament will forgive me for saying that the commission wishes to play a different role in this whole area . 
as to the matter itself , it is really quite simple . 
a french university and a british university have entered into a contract with an educational establishment in greece and students from france , britain or any other country study in those institutions in greece . 
they take their examinations there under the supervision of the french or british university , and the degrees which are eventually granted are british and french degrees . 
if then the student in that establishment , perhaps a greek student , does not gain recognition for his diploma or degree in greece , then i am afraid there is no alternative other than for him to address himself to the greek authorities saying that he has been awarded a french or a british degree en bonne et due forme , as the french expression is . 
he should therefore address himself to those authorities in order to get redress . 
i am afraid the commission cannot do anything in that respect , but it will of course follow such cases with extreme interest . 
question no 49 by ( h - 0912 / 00 ) 
subject : transport links across the straits between vaasa , finland and umeå , swedenshipping in the narrows of the gulf of bothnia is to be discontinued , since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax - free sales . 
this is very harmful to the varied relations between the two regions , and i can think of only three ways of helping : 
obtaining a eu subsidy to support the unprofitable regional traffic network , 
building a bridge ( or tunnel ) to cross the straits at a suitable point , or 
declaring the island of raippaluoto off vaasa an independent kingdom , through which shipping firms can pass and thus continue their tax - free sales . 
the king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving finnish meps ! 
for example , in vaasa , the city i mentioned , 550 jobs have been lost in the last two years in the travel and tourism industry alone , which may have been the result of stopping duty - free sales . 
mr president , as i said a little while ago , at present i am not able to say what will be the outcome of the commission 's deliberations with regard to the proposals submitted by finland and sweden . 
2000 / 0128 ( cns ) ] . 
president , i welcome this initiative from the commission . 
this proposal reflects the goal of the lisbon summit by aiming to stimulate the development and the use of digital content . 
in doing so i trust that europe 's position in the knowledge - based global economy will be consolidated . 
owing to the fast - changing nature of this sector , the eu needs to take immediate and concrete measures since the new communication technologies are already generating demand for content , products and services as well as having considerable social impact . 
if we do not act and tackle the barriers that undermine the potential of european industry , then the european citizen will pay the price not only in terms of slower economic growth and lower employment opportunities , but also in terms of cultural and social influence . 
if i can say briefly what is important in my report and what i believe is the key priority for this parliament , it is the issue of linguistic diversity . 
we in europe are lagging behind the us because at present the eu market is fragmented as a result of linguistic and cultural diversity . 
that is the reason why i propose the amount of budget earmarked for this sector . 
in my view we must adopt an inclusive approach in relation to languages and a pledge to commit more funding to this area , precisely because european smes are dissuaded from setting up websites in different languages by the burdensome cost that they incur . 
i cannot under - estimate the importance of customising our content . 
by ensuring that it is conveyed to each and every corner of the eu we underwrite our goal of a fully integrated and functional information society . 
it should not be necessary to master the english language in order to find interesting content on the internet . 
another key area that parliament is keen to develop further is how we lend additional support to market enablers , recognising that in recent months the sector has experienced a particularly volatile period . 
as has been said , information ought of course to be available to businesses , but it ought also to be accessible to everyone . 
i therefore want us to emphasise the possible democratic aspect of digital content or e - content . 
secondly , i should like to point out to the commission that it chose not to define the term ' digital content ' and that this gives me grounds for concern . 
i should like to know what will be included under the heading of ' content ' . 
-- ( fi ) mr president , the digital content industry is characterised by a growth in the quantity of information . 
information is the raw material of the content industry , and , in addition , multimedia fully exploits the opportunities afforded by the entertainment and leisure industry in order to increase production . 
there are no restrictions , as there were previously , to the supply of digital information . 
digital content , which is more quantity than quality , standardises and prunes cultural and social diversity . 
although linguistic differences might mean extra costs , multilingual content is an important precondition of democracy in the eu . 
to overcome problems we need a language industry which concentrates on customised linguistic services and diversifies the language infrastructure of digital content . 
commissioner liikanen , by the year 2003 we shall probably have 1.7 million job vacancies in the information society in europe which cannot be filled , and i believe that this in itself makes it essential that we devote the utmost attention to the question of digital content . 
we shall be investing many millions of euros in the net infrastructure ; by the year 2003 it is expected that there will be more than a billion mobile phones in the world , and 85 % of the european population will be using the internet . 
the sums that will be invested here naturally bear no relation to the total investment in software , in digital content . 
so there is a huge gap that we must close as soon as possible , because we shall not only create jobs by installing transmitters , by the way we link them together and by the way we develop software ; we shall also have to become prolific producers of digital content . 
what do we have to do to encourage such production ? 
first of al. and my thanks are due to mr seppänen for thi. we took the same view in the committee on budgets as has been expressed here and now in the chamber and by the committee on industry external trade , research and energy , namely that we need a massive injection of new funding for digital content . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as everyone has been saying this evening , the programme we are debating is designed to help establish a large european market for digital content , accessible to both industry and the general public . 
the programme and the report are therefore very important and , in connection with these , i want to thank the commission and commissioner liikanen , as well as mrs gill . 
i shall not go back and discuss all the objectives of this programme which consist in creating conditions favourable to the sale , distribution and use of digital content in such a way as to encourage economic activity , broaden the scope of employment and encourage exploitation of the potential of european digital content over and against that of digital content from the united states . 
i want to emphasise the importance of the objective of promoting multilingualism in digital content on the world networks , particularly for european languages . 
i also want to say how important it is for citizens of the european union to be able to develop professionally , socially and culturally and how important it is to avoid , in this area , the creation of that digital divide to which we refer so often in our debates . 
we are therefore concerned here with a programme and a report which are very important both from economic and employment points of view and , once parliament has voted on it , i want to see the programme quickly adopted by the telecommunications council which , i believe , is due to meet on 22 december . 
before i conclude , allow me to raise a final important point , a final question addressed to the commission . 
that is why i support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies . 
in as much as i too am the rapporteur for one of the reports on the telecom package , i think it is important for europe to make arrangements and propose to us programmes for... . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
european firms are in the best position to localise services geographically and tailor them culturally and linguistically to users ' needs . 
thus having the right conditions in place for european multilingual digital content production is becoming increasingly important . 
in response to this challenge , the commission has proposed a five - year programme with the aim of accelerating the process of transformation and filling the gap open in the mobile services : three specific lines with the help of strategic studies and input from market actors who are identified in the areas where impact at european level can be maximised , namely , stimulating the exploitation of public sector information , enhancing linguistic and cultural customisation , and supporting market enablers . 
the budget proposed by the commission is eur 150 m over five years . 
we have to have put in place fast and simplified procedures for the execution of programmes . 
in this connection it is worthwhile to notice that as part of the administrative reform , the commission has recently adopted a communication on the simplification of its decision - making procedures . 
we intend to make maximum use of these measures and reduce as much as possible the time between the presentation of a project proposal and a decision on its financing . 
in conclusion , out of 49 amendments voted by the committee , let me say that the commission can support 23 as they are , and 15 are acceptable in principle subject to reformulation . 
to that end , i ask you to support the motion proposed by mrs oomen - ruijten . 
thank you , mr de roo . 
too much noise from infrastructure affects the health of human beings , and reduces their quality of life . 
eight years ago , the commission promised to come forward with legislative proposals for european harmonised noise indicators before 1994 and for eu - wide noise standards before 1995 . 
only this year , six years overdue , and under enormous pressure from the french government , has the commission at last proposed european harmonised noise indicators . 
those proposals are sound . 
lnight is an efficient indicator for sleep disturbance and the overall noise indicator lden is probably the best in its field . 
this indicator sets 12 hours for the day , 4 hours for the evening and 8 hours for the night . 
noise at night is calculated times 10 and noise in the evening times 5 . 
in this proposal , the environmental committee lays down specific standards for the years 2006, 2012 and 2020 . 
setting ever stricter noise standards must reduce noise levels of aircraft around airports . 
i will give you one example : the dutch government introduced the margins of the night at beek airport , which amounted to a flight ban between 1 and 5 a.m. as a result , noisy aircraft took their freight transport to ostend , the belgian seaside resort , which met with protest from the people in ostend . 
at present , exactly the same noisy aircraft land in the middle of the night at the airport of liège , 60 km south of maastricht . 
that is not doing the european citizens any good , and that is why these standards are required . 
mr president , environmental noise is one of the oldest environmental problems we know . 
despite this , noise was not considered a serious environmental problem for a long time . 
now that environmental noise has gone through the roof , increased mobility being one of the specific causes , the number of people facing this problem has also increased greatly . 
i therefore welcome the commission proposal , although i consider it to be an initial an. in my opinio. cautious step . 
as far as legislation is concerned , i would , however , like to prioritise and , initially , to opt for regulation of noise around airports . 
after all , wherever we are based , it appears that noise around airports is experienced as particularly disturbing . 
i would like to finish off with a word of thanks to the rapporteur . 
mr president , the commission 's green paper on future noise - abatement policy , which appeared in 1996, stated that 20 % of the population of western europe , in other words almost 80 million people , were exposed to noise levels that the experts deemed to be intolerable . 
the rapporteur has now quoted far higher percentages , but the fact is that ambient noise is a serious and a major environmental problem . 
that is why the reduction and prevention of ambient noise will feature prominently in future european environment policies . 
my group , however , does not support the rapporteur 's intention to use the directive to introduce limit values for ambient noise in the vicinity of airports . 
we have discussed the relevant amendments thoroughly in committee , but we believe that our line of approach , whereby quality standards for all specific sources of noise are to be the subject of daughter directives , is the more logical and consistent strategy . 
another important proposal we have made , which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise , is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated . 
i therefore ask for your support for the amendment on the introduction of a noise indicator which defines a maximum level in addition to those which define mean levels . 
mr president , for years , national and local governments heavily underestimated the effects of noise in the workplace and at home . 
the fact that people became sleepless and stressed out and that their hearing became damaged , seemed to take second place to economic growth . 
now that traffic noise , especially , is ever increasing , far - reaching measures have become inevitable . 
the largest airports are located in densely populated areas and their environments are becoming less and less inhabitable . 
it is important that , in those areas , everyone is guaranteed at least eight hours of peace and quiet at night and that governments no longer allow hours to be pinched from this total after designating these hours the so - called margins of the night . 
it is unacceptable that we should have to wait five more years to set the noise limits to be applied throughout the european union . 
i therefore agree with the rapporteur , mr de roo , when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive . 
the lack of common standards in the european union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different member states . 
it is , therefore , essential that binding limits should be set on aircraft noise near airports . 
i believe , however , that amendment no 36 is not the most sensible way to go about this . 
in any case , i congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr de roo , in very many ways , this directive is unique , really , for the simple reason that noise and the disturbance it causes are actually being recognised for the first time as a social and ecological problem . 
in line with this directive , noise expressed in decibels is a measure of the standard of living . 
credit should go to the rapporteur , in the first instance , and the support he has received in committee . 
the aim of this framework directive is to combat noise pollution on behalf of the european citizen . 
we must give the commission the time to do something about this , providing it does not take too long . 
that is why , in my opinion , the amendments tabled by mr bernd lange are so important . 
i do hope they will meet with support and that the commission will issue well - founded standards within eight months from now , because that is what it is all about , and i hope that we can reach a compromise in this area too . 
mr president , spain has supported and continues to support the policy of combating noise in general and in particular supports this community directive , as well as the good work of mr de roo . 
this is the establishment of a nuisance factor for noise after 7.00 p.m. , which the proposal for a directive calls the ' evening ' . 
the commission proposal , in point 1 of annex 1, intends to systematically add on five decibels for all noise created between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m . 
for climatic and cultural reasons , life in spain is lived later than in many other parts of europe . 
it is obvious that the nuisance which may be caused by noise between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. varies according to the different ways of life in each place . 
in spain and in many mediterranean countries , the normal day extends considerably later than the 7.00 p.m. indicated in the directive . 
for that reason the most important elements of this report are the need to have harmonisation of measurement and assessment methods across the whole of the european union so we can talk in comparable terms about the problems . 
we also need to build noise maps and measure the real problem in every locality to establish what can be done in each case and adopt local measures to do that and eventually , by a step - by - step approach , we can arrive at a real action programme which is cost - effective in the measures that we adopt and which achieves the solution that we are looking for , a genuine reduction in noise levels and consequent improvement in human health . 
some parts of the report propose too rapid and far too quick an approach to a problem which has not been properly and carefully assessed . 
it seems to me , for example , that the setting of noise limits at this time is presumptive . 
we need to assess exactly what measures can be taken at a local level and whether we need noise limits in future . 
this is the first directive that deals with ambient noise as distinct from noise from a particular common source and that is to be welcomed . 
we all know the health hazards that noise brings to all our lives . 
it is an increasing hazard and how we go about handling it will be a measure of how successful we are . 
we cannot bounce people or communities or industries into specific standards without proper dialogue and consultation . 
could i also ask whether the commission could refer to the business impact assessment , which i am assuming they carried out on this proposal as is required under the treaty . 
i would like to know what the bottom line actually was . 
i would fully support the need to harmonise noise indicators and assessment methods ; the whole area of noise maps ; the drawing up of action plans to reduce noise and protect quiet areas as appropriate and to broaden the whole scope for information to the public . 
i would also hope that when we get to a daughter directive , rather than this framework directive , in which we have the specific standards for an eu - wide playing field that the terrain and conditions and demography in each area will be taken into account and we will have time to debate that properly . 
that is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it . 
for example , amendment no 36 cites average measurements particularly in relation to night - time but one aircraft in the eight hours of night - time could come in so loudly and so noisily that it could wake the entire neighbourhood and yet comply with what is required by amendment no 36 . 
that may seem the logical way to control the level of noise but it would be premature to set new limit values in this way for two main reasons . 
firstly , because we already have market access legislation which set limit values for many road vehicle types and for equipment used outdoors . 
it would be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in the existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives . 
we will consider what these standards needs to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps . 
secondly , this proposal uses a new approach to assess the overall noise situation in europe in terms of numbers of people who are disturbed by noise . 
it is impossible at the moment , because we use such a large variety of indicators and assessment methods , to characterise noise in different member states . 
a particular problem is the noise around airports . 
because of commercial competitiveness between airports and between aviation manufacturers it has not been possible to obtain correct and verified noise levels . 
the second criterion is usefulness to the consumer . 
it seems that treatment with alginate may mislead the consumer , since the food may appear fresher than it really is . 
there are many such substances , and i would remind you that , in 1992, the scientific committee for human food recommended that a study be carried out of the contribution of other food components with potential laxative effects to the overall dietetic burden of substances with this biological property . 
this study has never been carried out . 
as a result , it would be only natural , as a precautionary measure and until such time as this study has been carried out , not to authorise new additives presenting this property . 
these are the three criteria . 
two of them do not satisfy us . 
i think it is perfectly right to refuse to authorise this additive . 
the others , although not dangerous , may present a potential health risk , especially when they are used in combination . 
there are always problems of synergy . 
we know that the commission is preparing a new directive on additives . 
i think that this would be of benefit to public health without causing any damage at all to industry . 
mr president , the ppe - de group voted in favour of the lannoye report within the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and it is , in fact , completely compatible with our wishes . 
i will therefore advise my colleagues to support the report , including the one amendment . 
we would not ask for peeled and cut carrots to be plunged into alginate , and support the rapporteur in his amendment . 
we would prefer it if this provision were deleted . 
mr president , at this late hour and with a piece of carrot stuck in my throat , i doubt whether i have much else to say to my fellow meps . 
i believe i have made the position of our group clear . 
thank you mrs thyssen , i sympathise with you , for while you have a carrot in your throat , i have a frog in my throat , as we say north of the rhine , but there is a bit of a flu bug going round in this house . 
mr president , i brought my carrots with me but wisely i did not , like mrs thyssen , attempt to eat them , although both would have passed the lannoye test . 
i never believed that my last speech in this house in the twentieth century would be about sodium alginates . 
but i could have bet that it would be in reply to a debate initiated by mr lannoye because he is an indefatigable champion of the consumer in matters great and small . 
in my humble opinion these matters are relatively smal. perhaps as small as these pieces of carrot . 
there is also an increased risk of children suffering from stunted growth . 
mr president , i want to thank the rapporteur , mr lannoye , and the committee of the environment , public health and consumer policy for the report on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on food additives other than colours and sweeteners . 
with regard to the amendment on the use of sodium alginate the proposal to extend this use to pre - packed peeled carrots was made by the commission in its original proposal in july 1999 . 
we have now re - examined this original proposal thoroughly and have come to the conclusion that it is appropriate not to authorise the new use of an additive such as sodium alginate in unprocessed foodstuffs . 
as the criteria for the authorisation of a new additive or additive use go beyond a simple safety assessment the commission can accept the amendment of parliament rejecting the extended use of sodium alginate in carrots . 
official inspections in the field of animal nutrition 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the discussion of this report on the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition is much like the end of one stage in some cycle race or other . 
ladies and gentlemen , i believe that approval of the joint draft text will guarantee us a win tomorrow . 
but that does not mean , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , that the yellow jersey is safe or final victory is in sight . 
as i already explained during second reading , there is a crisis underlying this directive amendment . 
after all , a number of years ago , it became clear that citrus pulp from brazil , which was contaminated with dioxin , had ended up in animal feed in the netherlands , belgium and in germany . 
it then also transpired that the commission did not have the right tools to tackle the problem adequately . 
that , ladies and gentlemen , is about to change . 
i noticed during the trialogue how member state governments put their own interests above the general interest . 
discussions with the french presidency were courteous , yet tough . 
i made every effort to ensure that the european commission can act independently in emergencies and certainly in cases where public and animal health are under threat , so without having to consult the member states . 
the measures issued by the commission apply with immediate effect and these must also be submitted to the standing committee on animal nutrition within ten days . 
the negotiations also meant tha. and i view this as a personal victory for this parliamen. the safeguard measures issued by the commission remain in force as long as they are not replaced by another legislative decision . 
a second problem was that the member states rather disliked our requirement to provide for the possibility of unannounced inspections . 
during the trialogue , it became clear that the council did not intend to shift from this position . 
now , after lengthy negotiations in the conciliation committee , an acceptable compromise has been worked out , involving a guarantee that safeguard measures taken by the commission will remain in force until they are replaced by another act and an obligation on the member states to provide full assistance to the commission officials carrying out on - the - spot inspections . 
one thing is sure : only if the member states and the commission cooperate and pool all their resources will we be able to achieve a higher level of safety in this sensitive field of animal nutrition . 
the ppe - de group supports the compromise that has been achieved . 
we stress , however , that we shall continue to keep a critical eye on developments and that we shall again respond to any problems in the appropriate manner . 
i would like to thank the european parliament for its support of the european commission 's position and the remarkable effort made to meet the concerns of the council . 
i welcome this legislation . 
mr president , there has been so much discussion of this issue , and we are so like - minded with regards to it , that the report does not actually have to be presented in the proper sense . 
but , anyway , the idea of sustainable urban development has grown into something significant in just the last few years . 
it is a question , mainly , of a horizontal approach , namely , that sustainable development is a common denominator for social , economic and ecological work in cities . 
we know that the commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the european union , and that should be ready in six months ' time . 
i hope that sustainable urban development will form a vital part of this sustainable development strategy . 
we know that the vast majority of europeans live in cities , and , until now , these matters , as far as cities specifically are concerned , have played second fiddle . 
the sum is not very large even now , but it will definitely enable us to start an inter - city networking programme so that our citizens , in particular , will be able to establish direct contact with the various players in the networks of different countries . 
in this way we can develop the european view on urban development . 
i hope that these resources will be used specifically for developing european cooperation from the point of view of our citizens . 
mr president , the european sustainable cities and towns campaign , which is made up of an alliance of 540 different local authorities , has committed itself to implementing local policies and actions geared towards promoting sustainability . 
it is really a question of putting in place best practices which can in a real sense develop our towns and cities in a positive manner . 
in ireland , urban renewal programmes are making a significant contribution to the upgrading of small towns and villages . 
the small town / village renewal programme is an integral part of rural development . 
eu structural funds , mainly through the esf , as well as national exchequer finances , must always be focused on developing disadvantaged and poorer areas in our society . 
the issue of sustainability does not only apply to towns and cities . 
there are many rural parts of the european union that need to be developed and sustained in a positive manner . 
unemployment black spots are both applicable to urban and rural areas . 
as a legislative institution we should not seek at any time to exacerbate the urban / rural divide . 
we need to develop marginalised and disadvantaged areas while supporting economic development and expanding social programmes . 
the planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner . 
mr president , excuse my being late , but debates at this time are got through more quickly than during the day . 
i am going to explain to you the factors which mrs lienemann would have liked to have presented to you herself if she had not been detained by other work . 
the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council , adopted by the european commission on 22 november 1999 and on a community framework for cooperation to promote sustainable urban development , follows on from the ' european sustainable cities and towns campaign ' , launched in 1992 . 
the state of the urban environment , in which approximately 80 % of the european population resides , is a fundamental topic of concern which has repercussions at local , european and world levels . 
it has to be said that the thorniest environmental problems at european level basically concern urban areas . 
they are often closely linked to global environmental challenges , and their impact is such that they directly influence the quality of life for millions of people . 
a coherent and sustainable approach to urban development policies may , however , significantly improve the quality of life in cities and towns . 
indeed , the concept of sustainable development , particularly in the case of cities and towns , is not , and cannot be , limited solely to the environmental aspect , but also embraces social and economic aspects . 
they may also represent a major threat to our natural environment , and the current challenge is to facilitate balanced urban development enabling cities and towns to continue to play an important role in contemporary society , as well as in the society of the future . 
one major challenge in creating an urban policy is to find the means of pursuing sustainable urban development objectives within the administrative structure of the city . 
that is why , in agreement with the other institutions , mrs lienemann , our rapporteur , has proposed slightly increasing the budget to eur 14 million in order to promote cooperation in this area between 2001 and 2004 . 
the appropriations would be mainly allocated to networks of towns and cities organised at european level and in order to support their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices where sustainable urban development is concerned . 
mr president , the citizens of europe undoubtedly demand a more favourable environment and we in this house must reflect those expectations and make it possible for them to be fulfilled . 
better knowledge and new technology provides the opportunity for a better environment in europe 's towns and cities . 
clear legislation and careful control of this are yet other tools . 
the towns and cities themselves have many of the instruments available to them , which help to improve the environment for their own citizens . 
it is often in the municipalities and towns that they are most aware of their own problems . 
with sensible town planning , well - functioning public transport and cooperation with other municipal interested parties , it is possible to provide citizens with a better environment . 
in practice , it is also at the local level that the environmental decisions we take here in parliament are to be implemented . 
the climate issue is a good example of this . 
therefore , i would like to support amendment no 31 . 
mr president , let me first even in her absence congratulate the rapporteur , mrs lienemann for her excellent work , and express my great satisfaction that , thanks to the constructive work of both parliament and the council , we might be in a position to conclude on this important initiative already at first reading . 
this proposal on sustainable urban development has the potential of having a direct effect on the daily lives as many as 80 % of the european population . 
it will enable and encourage towns and cities throughout europe and beyond to come together and learn from each other 's experiences , help them to tackle environmental problems and challenges and to work towards sustainability . 
the commission is also grateful for the substantial support which the european parliament has provided for this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been put forward . 
the commission recognises the importance of promoting good governance and transparency in its decision - making process . 
accordingly , we are strongly in favour of the establishment of a platform of dialogue with the key stakeholders to help determine the priority themes to be supported . 
its innovative approach will involve cooperation with the city networks , member states , eu institutions , ngos and the business community , ensuring that the funds provided from the framework are targeted at those areas of sustainable development most in need of them . 
i believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow . 
the budget for this proposal has been the subject of some debate with a wide range of views expressed about the appropriateness of the eur 12.4 m originally proposed by the commission . 
rather , the framework is designed to facilitate the sharing of information and ideas about the best practice of sustainable urban development so that the solutions identified to problems in one city or town can be shared with the other cities and towns throughout europe and beyond . 
the quality approach of the framework and its multiplier effects are such that despite the relatively small budget it is expected to have a real impact on the promotion of sustainable urban development in europe . 
the forty - one amendments have been given detailed consideration and the commission is able to accept thirty of them , either completely or in principle . 
amendment no 33 proposes a revised budget for the proposal of eur 14 m . 
we must make it clear that the commission 's general line on such matters is that no budget increase can be accepted without additional resources being transferred by the council and parliament to the relevant budget lines . 
in this specific instance , however , and on the basis that it will facilitate the adoption at first reading , the commission has exceptionally agreed to accept an increase of the financial scope of the proposal to eur 14 m without the provision of additional resources . 
while we are willing to support a figure of eur 14 m we cannot support a figure of eur 20 m as proposed by amendment no 14 . 
the second issue relates to commitology . 
given the nature of the activity , the commission can accept amendments nos 10 and 23 . 
establishment of a consultative committee would be the appropriate commitology solution . 
so , to conclude , the commission can fully accept amendments nos 2, 5 to 8, 10 to 13, 15, 16, 18 to 20, 22 to 24, 28, 30, 32 to 35 and 37 . 
the commission can in principle accept amendments nos 25, 27, 36, 40 and 41 . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1, 3, 4, 9, 14, 17, 21, 26, 31, 38 and 39 . 
amendment no 31 would allow ngos , universities etc. to be involved as main partners in the networks to be supported . 
it is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development . 
i am also happy that the spirit of the interinstitutional cooperation has been such that the adoption of this proposal at first reading should be secure . 
thank you , commissioner liikanen . 
the debate is closed . 
in order to explain the result i should like our parliament to arrive at , i should like this evening quickly to underline two key aspects of this debate . 
the first issue raised by the report we are debating is of a legal nature . 
indeed , even if it is only recently that the media have begun publicising it , the precautionary principle has not only just made its appearance on the international legal scene . 
a good many treaties and international agreements refer to it . 
however , these references in international texts are not enough to specify either its nature or its legal value , especially since such texts do not include any definition of the precautionary principle . 
this gives rise to a degree of legal insecurity unacceptable not only to our fellow citizens but also to industrialists who no longer know what fate has in store for them . 
the second key task in our work on the precautionary principle is of a more political nature . 
what the european union has to do is to is to promote a unified conception of the precautionary principle , not only so that this principle may be a part of all policies implemented by the european union within the scope of its jurisdiction , but also so that reference may be made to this european approach in respect of our partners who often have a less ambitious approach than ourselves where environmental and health matters are concerned . 
we are gratified to note that the bulk of the text of the resolution , at which we have arrived after several debates within the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , coincides with the council resolution , appended to the conclusions of the nice summit . 
for this reason , i recommend that we follow the line that the rapporteur has mapped out for us . 
mr president , i should like to thank mrs patrie for her excellent report on this commission communication on the complex subject of the precautionary principle . 
there is a crisis of public confidence in science , which is now recognised as not being infallible , and there is also a crisis of public confidence in political decision - makers , who are suspected of connivance with certain industrial and commercial pressure groups or simply of culpable irresponsibility . 
prudence is called for in situations where the risks are known . 
in those situations , a safety margin is imposed as a precautionary measure . 
the precautionary principle is a political response to the risks within society . 
we must avoid unknown risks . 
the precautionary principle must also apply to products and substances which are already available and in use , as well as to production methods . 
i am in favour of the precautionary principle , but i would like to mention one area of concern . 
i sometimes have the feeling that reference is made to the precautionary principle all the time , whether appropriate or not . 
there is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products , nor can there ever be . 
the present situation is taken as a point of departure and that leads to conservatism and resistance to anything new . 
in this way , we are distancing ourselves from the united states and large sections of the rest of the world . 
that may be the case and so be it , but worse still is that the precautionary principle can produce a whole generation of political cowards , a generation which passes the buck and does not dare to take any decisions out of precaution . 
it leads to the scientification of a policy without ever reaching consensus , for science is unable to offer that either . 
the precautionary principle is therefore a valuable and important principle , but we must aim to use it more sparingly . 
mr president , no one is in any doubt about the importance of the precautionary principle and i warmly welcome both the commission communication and mr patrie 's report . 
in the committee on industry , we underlined the importance of having clarity on the modalities for the application of the principle . 
so i am pleased to see that the final report reflects the need for further elaboration of the concept . 
we also called for measures in the world trade organisation , perhaps a regulation , which would ensure that it is possible , in the context of the wto , to invoke other obligations , such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements , to extend the scope of the precautionary principle . 
in that context it would be helpful if the commission would confirm its position that withdrawing a product on the basis of process or production methods may indeed be a legitimate application of the principle . 
the proposal is of course , from an international point of view , an invaluable tool for decision - making in cases where there is uncertainty regarding risks , products or manufacturing methods . 
just like many meps , i ' m sure , i was pleasantly surprised at the council 's resolution from the european council meeting in nice which states that the precautionary principle should be applied as quickly as possible after harmful effects to health and the environment have been established and if reliable conclusions concerning the level of risk cannot be reached on the basis of a preliminary scientific investigation based on the information available . 
this is very far - reaching and , of course , very good . 
i would also like to appeal to everybody here , in anticipation of tomorrow 's vote , not to weaken the committee 's and the rapporteur 's text by adopting the amendments proposed by the edd and the ppe . 
instead , we ought to try to strengthen the text further to show that we are at least as progressive as the council . 
amendment no 9 is very important . 
this proposes that a reversed burden of proof be applied regarding products with no prior approval , that is to say that producers must prove that the product is safe and not transfer the risks and the cost to consumers . 
it is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard . 
this is dealt with in amendment no 5 from the group of the greens . 
in my amendments which i have tabled , i attempt to clarify these matters and delete a number of redundant paragraphs . 
as science is often unable to establish a direct link between products and their possible harmful effects , we demand more clarity in the matter . 
in order to apply the precautionary principle , it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects . 
both restriction and acceptance of a certain level of risk are important in order to take measures . 
in addition , it is important for us to give due consideration to the protection level we have opted for , which can largely be deduced from the legislation we have drafted . 
finally , i am of the opinion that reversal of the burden of proof is not appropriate . 
in order to use the precautionary principle correctly , we also need to know what the harmful effects will be of any alternatives , should a prohibitive measure be taken . 
but there is still a long way to go in perfecting this principle . 
first of all , it is still typically european : on the other side of the atlantic this instrument is seen as obscurantist and even mediaeval . 
yet the way the european union itself uses it is both unclear and even irrational . 
sometimes it overuses it , cheapening it , and at other times it uses it too little and provokes our indignation . 
by establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied , it clarifies its use at a european level , making it more credible , and it mandates the european negotiators in the next round of the world trade organisation to inscribe the precautionary principle as basic and universal . 
but allow me to denounce what i see as a flagrant example of the lack of coherence in the use of the precautionary principle in the european union : i am talking about mobile telephones . 
this is the precautionary principle in practice . 
however , this is not how it works in the case of public health . 
in my opinion , the precautionary principle is quite simply about the law and not least the duty to intervene with sufficient and necessary resources on the basis of a suspicion or a probable suspicion that a substance or a process may cause irreparable damage to the environment and health . 
those who cannot live without the substance or process in question must demonstrate that it can exist without resulting in permanent damage . 
amongst other things , the commission proposes that the benefits and costs associated with action or failure to act in an area are to be investigated . 
however , this was precisely what was done in connection with the bse scandal and that was why the catastrophe hit england and now also france , which had been given all the signals that bse was present and still did not want to apply the precautionary principle . 
an analysis of the pros and cons is an absurd concept bearing in mind the idea behind the precautionary principle , namely to be able to react to a product before we fully know all the advantages and disadvantages . 
after all , if we know all the risks , costs , etc. , then there is no need for the precautionary principle . 
i also think that far too much emphasis is placed on the assessment of a matter by experts , toxicologists and economists . 
mr president , adapted to every contingency , according to the circumstances and interests of the moment , the precautionary principle may be either the best of things or the worst of things . 
by invoking this principle willy - nilly , there is a risk of ending up with products which are all produced in the same way and are so hygienic , odourless and tasteless as to be undifferentiated . 
mr president , i would like to express my appreciation for parliament 's initiative in addressing the topic of the precautionary principle and for the excellent work of the rapporteur , mrs patrie . 
this commission 's communication on the precautionary principle was issued in february this year and it proposes guidelines on when and how to use the precautionary principle . 
the principle and approach is often referred to at national , european and global level when questions related to human health and the environment are discussed . 
the precautionary principle was also discussed at the nice summit , which took note of a resolution adopted by the general affairs council . 
the resolution calls on the commission to use the guidelines adopted and to incorporate the precautionary principle whenever necessary in drawing up its legislative proposals and in all its actions . 
the resolution also highlights the need to work actively for a commitment by international partners to reach an understanding on the application of the principle . 
we now examine how this resolution should be followed up . 
we consider it as a general principle which should be taken into consideration in the fields of environmental protection and human , animal and plant health . 
parliament must have noted that the commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution . 
however , i would like to clarify some points . 
concerning the eventual withdrawal of a product on the basis of process or production methods , it is not possible to make any general statement on the legitimacy of such an action prior to a comprehensive risk assessment . 
the distinction made in the resolution between the precautionary principle and prudence would need to be more precise . 
the prudential approach is part of risk assessment policy and is an integral part of the scientific opinion delivered by the risk evaluators . 
on the other hand , application of the precautionary principle is part of risk management . 
one consequence of this is that initial suspicions or empirical judgments cannot be used alone as regards the application of the precautionary principle . 
the hazard has to be identified and risk assessment has to be carried out by experts before measures are taken . 
to conclude , i would like to thank parliament for its support in addressing this issue . 
the motion for resolution will help foster a general understanding of the precautionary principle both within the community and internationally . 
thank you , commissioner liikanen . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m . 
( the sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m ) . 
sakharov prize for 2000 
through yourself , the european parliament pays tribute to the victims of terrorism and rewards a citizens ' movement which has spontaneously decided to cry ' basta ya ' , or ' enough is enough ' , to those who deny the right to life , that most precious of commodities for every human being , and who also deny the right to freedom , that is to say the freedom to live in daily peace and security . 
our european community is above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law . 
the european charter of fundamental rights , which we proclaimed in nice as recently as 7 december 2000, bears witness to this . 
article 2 of the charter enshrines the right to life , and each time someone is killed by terrorism in spain , the whole of the european union senses the relevance of what is one of its most crucial principles . 
the democracy in which we believe is about using language to debate and convince . it involves respect for the other person and submits to the will of the majority of the people in a free vote .

( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
before we proceed to the explanations of votes , i would like to wish all those members i will not be seeing afterwards a very merry christmas . 
my vote against the agreement which will allow more lorries on the swiss roads as from 1 january is unrelated to the number of permits which dutch hauliers managed to secure in the process . 
although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low , they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them . 
this agreement forms part of an initiative by means of which switzerland and norway will increasingly take on the guise of eu member states . 
the only difference is that they do not pay a contribution and do not have a right to vote . 
as a result , their governments can continue to reassure a critical population of their on - going independence , although that is less and less the case . 
however , far more important is the fact that this agreement will generate a great deal of extra freight traffic on the roads . 
after austria , the alps barrier is now also disappearing in switzerland . 
that country had previously opted for discouraging road traffic and improving rail connections for freight transit traffic . 
allowing an increasing number of larger lorries on the roads will force switzerland to invest more in motorways . 
i am not at all convinced by the fact that large swiss environmental organisations have been sweet - talked into this with the argument that the revenue from levies will benefit the expansion of rail . 
this agreement is attractive to a number of companies but detrimental to the environment and democracy . 
general budget for 2001 
at the second reading of the budget , parliament has just approved the full reinstatement to the cohesion fund budget line of eur 360 million , which it had placed in reserve on the first reading . 
for the portuguese socialists , the cohesion fund is a mainstay of the economic and social cohesion policy , which was launched by the single european act and substantially strengthened by the maastricht treaty . 
since it was set up , the cohesion fund has had a considerable impact on two areas of great community interes. the environment and trans - european transport networks ; it has been effectively implemented in the community budget and has had one of the highest implementation rates in the entire community budget . 
as our comrade , mário soares , stated at the investiture of the current prodi commission , the most negative point in its programme was the abolition of the service directorate for this fund and its removal from the name and directory of the former directorate - general xvi . 
this abolition , which began to take place in the middle of last year , as we had anticipated , resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made , to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of june 2000 was less than one per cent . 
in its proposal to parliament to cut eur 360 million from the 2001 payments , the commission was showing worrying signs of a lack of interest , motivation and will to fully implement the financial package agreed upon by the berlin european council . 
after this proposal , the portuguese socialists decided to vote against the budget at its first reading if it did cut eur 360 million from the draft budget , agreeing to vote for the budget only when this position was changed to place this money in reserve . 
in the face of the joint efforts by the representatives of several governments in the council , particularly the portuguese government , and members of various parliamentary groups , in which it is fair to highlight the portuguese socialist members , the trialogue held between the commission , the council and parliament decided to reinstate the whole of the funding laid down in the first council reading for the cohesion fund payments , and parliament has just ratified this position . 
we are delighted with this decision and now commit ourselves to remaining vigilant over the implementation of the cohesion fund . 
the debate at second reading on the 2001 budget gives rise to the same feelings we had last october and therefore leads us again to voting against the budget . 
as we pointed out at first reading , aid to the balkans by no means justifies a revision of the financial perspective , and nor does it mean , spuriously , that the fisheries agreements with morocco should be challenged , by entering eur 130 million into a reserve . 
we are delighted that this has now been acknowledged . 
the most significant event to have occurred since our previous budgetary debates is , of course , the " mad cow " crisis . 
the gravity of the situation has led our group to table a number of amendments highlighting the importance of earmarking the necessary funds for standardising screening tests and for compensation for them , as well as for massive aid to the cattle industry , which has been severely affected . 
many people will be blissfully unaware of the fact that this is actually an indirect attack on strasbourg too . 
back in july , parliament decided by a narrow majority that , during the 12 plenary weeks when we would have to meet in strasbourg in the course of 2001, the house would only sit from monday afternoon until thursday , the friday sittings being discontinued , a decision which was , in itself , a first tilt at strasbourg . 
perhaps the french have even resigned themselves to this , if we are to believe the report in a german newspaper on 13 december , according to which president chirac , in a piece of out - and - out horse - trading , is supposed to have promised the recalcitrant belgian prime minister ( who is now being hailed as the hero of nice ) that in future all summit meetings , as well as an additional week of plenary sittings of the european parliament , would be held in brussels . 
this was allegedly the price for the ' hero of nice ' agreeing to accept fewer votes in the council than the more populous netherlands under the system of qualified majority voting . 
the adoption of this paragraph will undoubtedly coincide with the re - emergence of the paper produced by a vice - president of this parliament who wants to shift all the services and the directorate - general from luxembourg to brussels . 
according to his plan , luxembourg will continue to house no more than a handful of technical services such as the print shop and the translation service . 
this would clearly violate the letter and spirit of the aforementioned decisions taken by the heads of state and government regarding the seat of parliament . 
i wholeheartedly support this report by mr staes on the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition . 
it allows the commission to take safeguard measures in emergency situations without consulting member states , and thus significantly increases the speed and efficiency with which cases can be dealt . 
the change from requiring " all necessary assistance " to " full assistance " from member states , and the fact that the european parliament has to be kept informed as to results , also indicate that this report is of genuine significance for all member states . 
the conciliation meeting of 23 november enshrined the use of all the sums available under the flexibility instrument , totalling eur 200 million , for serbia , and this is to be welcomed , even if we must deplore the fact that parliament has had to reverse the decision it took at first reading , which favoured meda . 
i suggest that he also sends a copy to malta , since the only time he has failed to give an explanation of vote was , i believe , when we were discussing malta . 
i do not think that valetta has ever quite recovered from this blow . 
mr president , i will do my best to remedy this before 2004 with a few explanations of votes in favour of malta . 
we do not feel that we should in any way endorse an operation that will only serve the interests of a few capitalist groups that are looking for an area of investment to generate private profit at the expense of the whole population , and more particularly , at the expense of those classes with the lowest incomes . 
the swedish social democrats in the european parliament consider that the postal market within the eu should be opened up to competition . 
by gradually deregulating the european market postal services can be made more efficient and the level of service to the customer raised . 
an end date would send a clear message to the players in the postal market and provide better opportunity for the national monopolies to prepare for deregulation . 
for this reason we have voted for an end date for liberalisation . 
we have therefore abstained in the vote on the ferber report . 
today i voted in favour of the ferber report on " european postal services " because , given the current balance of power in europe and within the european parliament , we obtained as much as we could to prevent the total disappearance of public postal services in europe ! 
this took intense negotiations and the greatest possible rallying together at all levels , but as of today , the main part has been saved ! 
we cannot , of course , undermine the principle of the adaptability of public services , which is what the commission suggested , since this lies at the very heart of the history of most of our countries and which we consider to be very important . 
it does not contain a new definition of special services , and 
the price and weight limits are set at reasonable levels , with weights of up to 150 grams remaining the sole preserve of the universal service , linked with a price ceiling of four times the public tariff . 
the limits of 50 grams and two and a half times the public tariff are truly too drastic and would have had dire consequences for the providers of universal postal services . 
this would also have been the case if outgoing cross - border mail and express services had been entirely liberalised , which the luxembourg postal service in particular , because of our country 's size and geographical situation , could not have withstood . 
the compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect , which means that i can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading . 
however , i repudiate the insinuations made by those who advocate forced liberalisation with no regard for the loss of people 's quality of life and jobs , who seek to present me and the honourable members who share my view as acting on behalf of the post - office lobby which is intent on preserving its monopoly . 
i emphatically reject such insinuations . 
they will keep the pressure on , and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams . 
the debate on the future organisation of the postal services has not entered the home straight by a long chalk . 
we have known that the extreme liberalisation proposal brought forward by the european commission had no chance of survival since rapporteur ferber made a few critical proposals with regard to further research , meticulousness and deadlines . 
the situation became even more clear - cut when christian democrats and social democrats concluded a secret deal on a compromise solution between liberalisation and non - liberalisation which was to be defended jointly by the two groups . 
the liberalisation of postal services on the terms proposed by the commission is neither appropriate nor consistent , and i therefore voted in favour of the report and all the amendments moved that expressed this position . 
furthermore , if approved , the drastic changes in weight and price limits for mail proposed by the commission would have extremely detrimental effects on the portuguese postal service , resulting in significant market losses and quite negative social implications . 
the fact that we have voted on this report in the december session is extremely important . 
parliament is thus sending the commission a strong signal regarding its reservations on the total liberalisation of the postal market . 
we feel that the member states themselves are much more competent to take care of these matters . 
however , we are happy to see inter - state solutions in this area . 
neither do we feel that there is any need or necessity to privatise , expose to competition or deregulate postal services . 
in sweden a number of these proposals have already been implemented and we can already see that this has exacerbated the situation . 
regional inequalities have arisen and the situation within the postal service has deteriorate. not least for the employees . 
de roo report ( a5 - 0378 / 2000 ) 
lienemann report ( a5 - 0350 / 2000 ) 
i do not feel that this is the right way to be spending the european union 's funds . 
dary report ( a5 - 0374 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the report on the common organisation of the market in bananas because , although trade in bananas must certainly be liberalised , pursuant to the treaty , we must also concern ourselves with the problems of the states making up the european union . 
we must have the courage to continue to protect those areas of the european unio. and i refer in particular to the most remote areas such as the canary islands and other area. which earn their livelihood from banana production and which need and have the right to be protected by the union as a whole , including the states who do not produce bananas . 
mr president , the british labour members welcome the passage of the dary report on the organisation of the banana market . 
we hope there will now be speedy negotiations to agree arrangements compatible with our wto commitments and safeguard our traditional suppliers . 
we have , however , reservations on amendments nos 6, 7, 11, 15, 16, 25 and 26, as we do not exclude the possibility of a tariff - only system in the future . 
we also have reservations on amendments nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, being not convinced that they are wto compatible . 
we hope the passage of the report will also lead to early suspension of the trade sanctions imposed by the usa , which operate in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors . 
the danish social democrats have today voted against the proposal for a common market arrangement for bananas . 
we do not believe that banana producers should be given more assistance . 
in this context , the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms forms a framework delineating the content for the sake of consumer protection . 
pursuant to article 10, freedom of expression goes hand in hand with duties and responsibilities which can result in conditions , restrictions and sanctions . 
in the light of this , regarding digital content , governments must , among other things , act in the interest of preventing criminal offences ( discrimination ) , protecting public health ( for example , provision of badly controlled medicines via the internet ) , public decency or the rights of others ( copyrights ) . 
we must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests . 
the report fails to point this out . 
secondly , the report takes an approach to linguistic and cultural diversity which is too negative . 
amendment no 8 reduces these to barriers to industrial development . 
this is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity ( article 6 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union ) . 
this proposal for a council decision is in line with the action intended to improve the networks of knowledge in europe . 
the actions that have been planned are designed to address the clear advantage held by the united states in the " digital content " sector and in its distribution by various means linked to the internet . 
europe is clearly in a position to respond to the challenge of the markets , due to its advantages in economic and employment terms , and , of course , due to its cultural wealth and linguistic diversit. which are shown clearly in the concept of linguistic minorities and regional language. over the monolingualism that characterises much of the " web " . 
mr president , i asked my daughter elisabetta , who , as you know , is the regional representative of the pensioners ' party for lombard. to give me her opinion on the nice council and to tell me whether she felt i should vote for the motion . 
she said to me : " yes , vote for the motion. and i followed her advic . 
" but you must call upon the european parliament to start to be resolute in presenting the proposal that parliament should have exclusive decision - making powers where certain subjects are concerned . 
the council has to start taking more of a back seat on certain matters , which must become and remain the exclusive legislative competence of the european parliament " . 
on the other hand , i hope that the intergovernmental conference announced for 2004, which seems to me to be the only positive outcome of nice , will deal once and for all with the distribution of competences between the european union and the governments of the member states . 
i voted against the joint resolution due to elements it contains which have been consistently opposed by the uk conservative party . 
it should , however , be emphasised that the strong endorsement of eu enlargement , highlighted by amendment 1, which was adopted , i wholeheartedly subscribe to . 
the fact that this did not happen is a missed opportunity . 
there was one positive aspect to the nice european council : by declaring a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of members of the european parliament that includes all of the candidate countries from the east , a powerful signal was given to these countries that we want to welcome them into the union soon . 
with regard to the form of the council , we note that it ended at dawn on the fifth day of negotiations , amid general exhaustion and uncertainty as to the exact shape that many of the decisions would take . 
the delay in the publication of the written conclusion. which are still not officially available , four days late. is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion . 
once again , in the haste and improvisation of the last night of the council , very wide ranging measures that had not previously been discussed were adopted , such as the appointment by qualified majority of the president and the members of the commission , which was not even mentioned for information only in the summary distributed by the presidency before the council . 
we wish to state once again that this method of decision making is completely unacceptable in democratic countries . 
the solution , however , is certainly not , as the federalists propose , to have the igcs prepared by conventions such as the one that drafted the charter of fundamental rights , because this would simply increase confusion , one - upmanship and a lack of realism . 
on the contrary , future igcs must now deliberate on a more solid basis , an agenda consisting of proposals adopted by a minimum numbe. for example , a thir. of national parliaments . 
this is the only way to refocus the discussion . 
with regard to the substance , we can decipher , from the tangled web of commitments , at least two tendencies that have been superimposed on one another . these are firstly the advance of supranationality to the detriment of national democracies and secondly the advance of german positions in the supranational decision - making process . 
with regard to the first tendency , the main aspect to highlight is the immediate or soon to take place extension of qualified majority voting on major issues , such as asylum and immigration policy , international agreements in the field of services and copyright , or even the appointment of commissioners . 
for us it was crucial in the entire process surrounding this intergovernmental conference that the last formal barriers to the enlargement of the eu be removed . 
this aim was achieved in nice , and seen in this light the summit was a success . 
a number of members of the european parliament argued in very strong terms for the agenda to be expanded . 
we warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year , with catastrophic consequences for enlargement . 
we have also always believed that a balanced solution between small and big countries should be found in connection with the composition of the commission , voting rights in the council of ministers and the composition of parliament . 
on this point , too , we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved . 
that would be too simple ! 
the mediocrity of the nice conclusions is the sad outcome of the lack of european ambitions of all the member states , and of the stubborn defence of their " private domains " and their last illusions of power . 
the basis for the future enlargement of the european union has been laid down . 
the negotiations were tough but the strength of the union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all . 
what was agreed was agreed in the best interests of europe and the member states . 
opting now for a convention or a european constitution is premature . 
a balance was found at nice and the heads of government and state must be congratulated on this . 
this was one of the most protracted issues and difficult elements of the negotiations . 
i have just voted in favour of the resolution of the european parliament on the nice summit . 
other positive aspects of this summit are the fact that the unanimity rule has been kept for decisions on both the structural funds and taxation , key areas for countries like portugal which still need the solidarity of the european union and the use of the tax system for a policy encouraging investment and saving . 
we cannot , however , ignore the fact that the solutions found for the complex decision - making system in the council and the corresponding vote weighting increase the gap between the more and the less highly populated states , which is something we regard as less positive because of our concept of a europe of sovereign nations . 
the resolution that was approved in this parliament does not reflect these positions and concerns of ours , and even sends out an appeal for the current method of intergovernmental conferences to be abandoned in future . 
in our view , for as long as europe is what it is , questions of a constitutional nature or of fundamental interest for the states , such as those that were debated in nice , should not be resolved by any other means ; that is , they should require unanimity . 
that is why my vote on this matter was negative . 
it is obviously a political pretence : the true democracy of europe is what happened there and not what was artificially planned by a majority in this house which is out of touch with the feelings of the peoples of europe . 
it is the same pretence which accompanied the earlier debates and which explains this resounding ' failure ' . 
the ' failure ' arises basically from the unrealistic way in which they represent the process of building europe . 
i refuse to recognise that this parliament has some higher legitimacy ; instead , i recognise in the heads of state and government of the fifteen meeting in nice the full democratic legitimacy of representing their respective peoples and nations , resulting from high - turnout elections . 
thus , notwithstanding reservations about the treaty , i above all oppose the sentiments expressed by the majority of this house , which , unfortunately , has still failed to learn from the facts and instead insists on approaches that will simply lead to more frustration . 
-- ( sv ) the treaty of nice means that the eu will become more supranational and centralised . 
it increases the power of the big countries at the expense of the small countries . 
no steps are being taken to make the eu more democratic or to increase the power of the national parliaments . 
on the contrary , the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the european parliament is being given more power . 
the enlargement is not being made easier ; rather the decision process in the council is being made more complex . 
we therefore oppose the principal orientation of the treaty of nice and will vote against it .

i welcome the steps to simplify the enlargement process that were taken at the european council summit in nice . 
as i have stated on a number of occasions , i am against the development of a common military defence force and cannot support qualified majority voting under the second pillar , i.e. within foreign , security and defence policy . 
garcía - margallo y marfil report ( a5 - 0334 / 2000 ) 
mr president , this time i did not consult my daughter but i did ask a pensioner who , as usual , came to see me off at the airport when i left for strasbourg what he thought of the report on fuel taxation . 
he replied : ' mr fatuzzo , fuel tax should be as low as possible so that aeroplane tickets cost as little as possible . 
we pensioners often travel and , to tell the truth , train and car journeys are tiring : for us , aeroplanes are a dream come true . 
you must therefore vote for this measure which further reduces taxation on aircraft , for this will bring the price of aeroplane tickets down and we will be able to travel much more frequently by plane . 
and while you are there , ask for a reduction in the price of aeroplane tickets for the elderly pensioners who travel. ' 
flying used to be expensive . 
the spectacular growth of air traffic over the past couple of years is the direct result of the proportionately lower price which consumers pay for this mode of transport . 
not only reduced staffing levels and other cuts , but also government policy have brought the prices down . 
from a taxation point of view , air traffic is given preferential treatment compared to land - based transport . 
if those effects had been foreseen in the year i was born ( 1944 ) when the chicago convention was concluded , it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon . 
the growth of air traffic is at the expense of rail traffic and the environment . 
it would be desirable if aircraft were no longer used for relatively short distances up to 1 000 km and if air traffic were restricted to intercontinental transport . 
i am indignant at the largest group and its attempt , within the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , to keep taxation on air traffic out of the equation as much as possible at a time when other groups were under - represented , because this did not do justice to the actual relations within that committee . 
patrie report ( a5 - 0352 / 2000 ) 
mr president , i voted for the document on the precautionary principle but i do have some reservations . 
this need had arisen because of the commission 's failure to make timely provision at the end of 1999 to cover this particular commitment . 
as the court of auditors noted in its annual report , other options were available which would have avoided the need to resort to the allocation for the current period from 2000 to 2006 in order to meet this legal obligation . 
this is an absolutely improper piece of cross - subsidisation between the berlin and edinburgh packages . 
we must therefore strive to avoid anything which would stifle or detract from these important three prerequisites . 
the trick is to know which will succeed and flourish but we should also have the strength to know that when something has failed we should not prop it up at public expense and develop a strategy that takes this into account . 
that is a fundamental objective for the commission : that the erdf , which has had its time and whose influence has been very positive , should become the motor for an increase in the competitiveness of our production system , particularly in the least - favoured regions . 
therefore , innovative factors like this one , however humble , must not be undervalued by anyone . 
so , from now on , special care must be taken when selecting the proposals submitted , so as to ensure that the relevant provisions are applied , especially those relating to transparency and avoiding cover - ups , and the proposals are implemented correctly , naturally with greater involvement on the part of the regional authorities . 
one especially good feature of this initiative is that it has enabled women in particular to familiarise themselves with new information technology and its applications . 
i do not know whether it is a direct consequence of this risi initiative that three ladies signed the european budget today , but i should be delighted if this christmas present on which we are deciding today could also continue to benefit women in the future . 
mr president , as the rapporteur who dealt with the innovative measures in the former parliament , in relation to the former article 10 initiative , i wanted to take part in this debate to remind the new commissioner of some of the points surrounding this which parliament has been consistently pressing for and which we do not want to see forgotten . 
we fought hard to keep the innovative measures within the new round of structural fund programmes and i am really pleased that we are here today , both confirming this and the eur 3 million that is going to be available through agreeing the new guidelines . 
i particularly want to record two findings for the commissioner . 
one is that w. and the people out ther. see that the innovative measures have been a very important stepping stone for local authorities and local communities who are not really into the structural funds , but should be , to learn how to do it through small - scale projects and then be able to become more effective parts of mainstream programmes in future years . 
we came up with a ten - point programme to say how that could be done . 
when i go back to my own region , east of england , and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period , i doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in . 
secondly , we talked about the need to work in partnership with local government and local authorities including , for example , through the directoria event . 
you are trying to allow regions to go away and come up with their own proposals and to come back and submit them to you . 
you are right to do that and i welcome what you are seeking to do . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the year 2000 is coming to an end and we are still debating the main guidelines , that is to say , the priorities in terms of innovative actions financed through the european regional development fund . 
if the berlin reform for the 7 years dealt with by agenda 2000, that is to say for the period 2000 - 2006, reduced the budgetary contributions for these actions by half in comparison with the previous period and , to that , we add the inevitable slowness with which we adopt decisions at a community level , as a result of our complex institutional structure , it is not surprising that we are in a situation where we have not even been able to spend the budget laid down for the current year for innovative regional policy measures , and this is an example of political irresponsibility . 
it is also a mistake to reduce the budget in a chapter such as this which was being dedicated to pilot experiments , to new ideas in the field of local and urban developmen. with some more than satisfactory result. which have formed the basis of community programmes as cherished at local level as urban and interreg . 
thank you , commissioner . 
i am sure the house would like to join me in wishing you too a merry christmas and a happy new year . 
the debate is closed . 
the commission 's target of january 2001 can only be met , in my view , if the republic of korea finally demonstrates willingness in the coming weeks to stop selling ships below local cost price ; to put it bluntly , it must raise its prices . 
the decision taken by the council and the commission to negotiate for four months without continuing the payment of aid and then , after 1 may 2001, to reconsider , on the basis of the progress achieved in these negotiations , whether there are grounds for resuming aid payments for a further period will mean that european shipyards will receive virtually no new orders in the first four months of the year 2001, at least not for the shipping categories in which competition is fiercest . 
even in our own area of specialisatio. the construction of cruise ship. the south koreans are able to offer ships below the prevailing international market price . 
at least 10 000 jobs are at stake , with the united kingdom poised to bear the brunt of the cuts . 
mr president , i wish to begin by congratulating my colleague , mr langen , on his excellent report which , as he says , was carried through the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , unanimously . 
i concur with his observation that we must take account of the third report that the commission has drawn up on world shipbuilding . 
i hope that the timing of the presentation of that report to parliament was not a ploy to encourage us to take this item off the agenda . 
it seems to me that the commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry . 
in the third report there is a list of actions proposed by the commission but its observations are rather disappointing : to continue with monitoring , to examine industry 's complaint , to remain open to eventual proposals , to pursue efforts , to continue to encourage , to continue to work closely with the industry or to examine the possibilities of measures . 
i submit that we need more than just examining possibilities and monitoring the industry situation around the world and in europe . 
in that context , it is important that the commission reconsiders the view about extending the time period for temporary support or for permitting temporary support for shipbuilding industries in the european union until a solution is forthcoming in talks with korea . 
that is why we welcomed the commission 's recent efforts , even if i do take issue with the calculation methods used to show very high levels of european aid in chapter 5 of the council report of 5 december . 
due to a lack of time today , i shall explain myself directly to the commissioner in writing on this point . 
neither will operating aid , not even specifically - channelled aid , solve the korea problem : that has to be firmly dealt with by means of trade policy , for example . 
we are in complete agreement on this : the subsidy race should end as soon as possible . 
however , it looks very much as if the goal posts are being moved each time , so that we will never reach the finishing line . 
but nearly everyone knows that within the european union too , there are large discrepancies in terms of subsidy level per order . 
in recent weeks , the commission has told us that the system of subsidies , thanks to which our industry is subsisting , must be removed as from january as a result of a supposed improvement in competitiveness . 
on the other hand , after more than two years of ferocious unfair competition on the part of korea , the commission has decided , after receiving a formal complaint from all our shipbuilders , to take the case to the world trade organisation . 
as you all know , it will take more than six months to carry out this procedure . 
furthermore , if successful , the creation of a group of experts within that organisation will mean that it will take at least two years . 
in the meantime , it is intended that what remains of our shipbuilding industry will subsist thanks to a package of aid to research and development , which will enter into force in january , as commissioner monti pointed out yesterday afternoon . 
we have held a meeting with him , in which i asked him a series of questions . 
that is , while we are enduring unemployment , the koreans are doing good business in their shipyards . 
both the author of this report and the authors of the proposed amendments belong to political schools which put the market economy before all else and cry excessive state intervention whenever it comes to supporting public services or giving workers some sort of social protection . 
but as soon as the capitalist groups whose interests they defend are in trouble on the markets , they call for governments or the european institutions to intervene , subsidise and protect the sector under threat . 
alstom - atlantique , which has just landed a contract to build a luxury liner , will collect the equivalent of 9 % of the contract price in subsidies . 
in other words , the state is paying a large chunk , if not all of the company 's profits . 
our internal and external policies are clearly at odds with each other , and this must be corrected . 
as a result of this failure , a complaint by industry under the trade barrier regulation has been launched in october this year and commissioner lamy announced on 4 december the commission 's decision to open an investigation . 
this process will not give quick results and if it goes to its ultimate conclusion , it will take up to two years . 
under regulation no 1540 / 98, the commission is obliged to propose measures . 
in reality , there are limited instruments available to the commission and member states in order to defend the eu shipbuilding industry . 
the potential of trade principles has not yet been seen and their effectiveness needs to be proved . 
discussions in the oecd have made little progress , very little progress , and the possibility of an internationally binding agreement on shipbuilding seems remote . 
the imf is also cautious on the issue of korean shipbuilding , as it sees itself as dealing only with macroeconomic conditions rather than with sectoral problems . 
improving competitiveness of the eu yards is encouraged by the commission but , in the face of massive price undercutting by korean yards , the achievable progress in productivity is not sufficient . 
nevertheless , all the available instruments should be used better , including aids for research and development . 
in the light of these factual elements , the commission concluded at its meeting of 29 november that if the commission does not achieve a satisfactory negotiated solution with korea in the framework of the tbr procedure , the commission will report to the council by 1 may next year and will propose to bring the case to the wto . 
in addition , and importantly , the commission will , at the same time , propose a defensive temporary support mechanism designed to counter the unfair korean practices . 
the commission is also ready to explore the possibilities of greater use of national support for research and development and it is noted that the general operating aids will expire after 31 december 2000 . 
i would like to explain the rationale behind the position adopted by the commission . 
the commission believes that the community should seek to strengthen its negotiating position vis - à - vis korea by providing an incentive to reach a rapid agreement that would resolve the current problems . 
on the question of research and development in the shipbuilding sector , the commission concluded that in addition to the substantial community funding available under research framework programmes which provide eur 130 m in five years , the possibility of improving the aids allowed for this purpose should be explored . 
industry should seriously reflect about how these instruments can be used to adapt their activities in a way which will ensure the future of the sector on a lasting basis . 
the industry council of 5 december this year discussed at length the shipbuilding issue based on the commission 's third report and its decision of 29 november 2000 . 
it requested the commission to continue with its market monitoring , to follow up closely on the tbr case with a view to bring the problem to the wto if required and to address the issue in all relevant international fora . 
the council also took note of the commission 's initiative to propose a temporary support mechanism for eu shipbuilding in case no progress is made with korea by 1 may 2001 . 
the council emphasised that such a support mechanism must not distort competition inside the eu . 
the commission will be reporting on this situation again in april and , of course , we are also available in the european parliament . 
thank you , commissioner . 
the debate is closed . 
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m . 
mr president , i simply wished to inform the house that this very morning the popular party councillor , francisco cano , was murdered in the town of villadecavalls , in the province of barcelona . 
francisco cano was 45 years old , married with two daughters and was an electrician by trade . 
he was a worker and , like those who accompanied us yesterday when we awarded the sakharov prize , he was a private citizen who served the democratic system which the spanish have chosen . 
i am sure that we are all now united in our vigorous and forthright defence of freedom in europe , but i wish to say that , more than the solidarity of the members of the european parliament , we in spain need their commitment . 
i do not think there is any need to add anything to what mr galeote has just said other than to assure him of our support and solidarity and i agree that , in future , we need to look at ways in which we can perhaps assist our colleagues in spain . 
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence ) 
british submarine at gibraltar 
ladies and gentlemen , your initial jeers , when i condemned this case on 5 july , and your laughter , have simply increased the desire of the andalusian people to be respected and not to be humiliated with shameful explanations and to be obliged to endure an unnecessary situation of risk . 
finally , do not allow the repair of this submarine in an inappropriate base . 
ask and demand that it be removed when the technical and climatic conditions allow it . 
commissioners , do not allow our gorgeous bay to become nothing but a workshop for nuclear junk . 
mr president , i will naturally begin by reiterating our solidarity with the members from the popular party , while at the same tim. although i find it difficult to sa. pointing out that our democratic response today in the face of this latest murder should be to overcome our grief and continue working in this house , as we are at the moment . 
once upon a time there was a british nuclear submarine called the tireless . 
while sailing through sicilian waters , back in the month of may , its nuclear heart showed worrying signs of deterioration . 
those in charge of the submarine tried to have it admitted into a hospital , classified as suitable for providing treatment , of which they were coproprietors , at that time a nato base . 
but the director of the hospital did not authorise the admission . 
the submarine sailed on , infecting the waters of the mediterranean on the way , until it arrived at an agreed hospital called gibraltar . 
there , showing themselves to be fully in charge , they parked it . 
in order that it might be admitted , they said that the illness was not serious . 
to top it all , it was at that time that the population most directly affected discovered that , some time before , that same country which owned the submarine had , for ten years , deceived all europeans about mad cow disease . 
ladies and gentlemen , this situation cannot be allowed to continue . 
europe and its institutions cannot remain on the outside . 
there is considerable and understandable alarm , the consequence of a perverse double combination of stubbornness and incompetence : the stubbornness of those people who refuse to alter their initial position and the incompetence of those who are unable to vigorously defend the health and safety of hundreds of thousands of european citizens who live in the area . 
i am not being alarmist . 
it would be alarming if we failed to act immediately in this situation . 
every day there are statements to the effect that there are reasons not to authorise the repair of the tireless in gibraltar . 
let us not wait any longer . 
let us accept the situation once and for all and take the submarine , with every possible safeguard , to a british port which fulfils the requirements for its repair , before it is too late ; before the tireless ends up wearing all of us citizens and europeans out . 
there is no doubt that very diverse interests are at play in this debat. and this is also the case within my group . 
however , we have made an effort to achieve dialogue and mutual understanding , which i believe could allow us to broaden this consensus on the basic issues to a majority in this house . 
in both , i truly believe that we agree on the essential issues . 
i would modestly like to suggest that they vote for our motion for a resolution . 
in that intervention i also pointed out the lack of seriousness and respect shown by the british authorities in reclassifying the role of the port of gibraltar , moving it in the best colonial fashion from category z to x for the purposes of being able to carry out repairs . 
i also pointed out the alarm amongst the 200 000 people who live in the area , within a radius of 10 kilometres . 
the evasive response that i received from the commission on that occasion forced me to ask a second question , on 21 september , urging the commission to ask the british government to remove the tireless to a british port , and also to monitor this issue . 
the reply received from the commission was disappointing and unsatisfactory . 
i hope that that feeling of dissatisfaction with the reply has nothing to do with the fact that commissioner patten is british , but , on the other hand , on the most important issu. the repair of the submarine in a european union port which does not meet the minimum requirement. he said that this was an internal issue for the united kingdom , when , according to the euratom treaty , this is not the case ; and , on the other hand , he simply said that he would keep parliament informed . 
nevertheless , since that moment the european parliament has received no information from the commission , despite the fact that it has promised to provide it . 
so , over these months , we have been on a wild goose chase . 
we have had statements from the responsible parties in the british army to the effect that the fault was not significant , and others saying the complete opposite , that it was serious and required long and difficult repairs . 
we have heard statements from the spanish government to the effect that there was no cause for alarm , and others , recent ones fortunately , from minister piqué , urging that the submarine be taken away as soon as possibl. although they have given a time period of three month. so that it may be repaired in the united kingdom . 
after visits to the submarine by spanish nuclear safety experts , we have heard that there is no danger , but we have had later statements indicating that they were not allowed to see , observe or inspect the actual site of the fault . 
for all these reasons , i believe the commission must be aware of what an anomalous situation we are dealing with and that , firstly , it must demand an immediate halt to any repairs taking place in gibraltar . 
secondly , it must demand that all possible information be given to the population , as laid down in the euratom treaty . 
thirdly , i believe that the british government should be taken to task for the irresponsibility and flippancy it showed in carrying out this reclassification , so that the port of gibraltar may return to its original category . 
i also believe that the submarine tireless should be taken to great britain to be repaired as soon as possible , as soon as the weather conditions are suitable . 
mr president , my group wishes to associate itself with the other supportive remarks made following mr galeote quecedo 's shocking announcement of the latest murder . 
we are fully in sympathy with the spanish people and very sorry to hear about it . 
this problem with the submarine has to be settled calmly and with full cooperation between all interested , relevant authorities . 
calm cooperation is the method which our union uses . 
turning to the problem of hms tireless , it seems to me that this is indicative of a more widespread difficulty in the equipment of the british armed forces as a direct result of policies pursued by the labour government . 
on the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card - carrying member of the campaign for nuclear disarmament as minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office , using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in europe and apparently realising rather too late that the european union defence scheme would indeed damage the nato alliance and transatlantic relations . 
on the other , the labour government is not prepared to ensure that the armed forces are provided with the resources to carry out the increasing burden of commitments being placed upon them . 
it is scandalous that , at this moment , 11 out of the 12 hunter - killer submarines in service in the royal navy are non - operational , with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts hms tireless . 
i point all this out because the maintenance and repair problem of tireless is a reflection of a wider malaise affecting the royal navy through cutbacks which have gone too far . 
and , as we have already heard , it has provided those that do not really have the wider , democratically expressed interest of the people of gibraltar at heart with an opportunity to make mischief . 
thank you , commissioner , for your reply which contains new and very important information for us . 
the situation we are talking about is extremely serious . 
it is the responsibility of those institutions that the citizens , in relation to the european union , should stop thinking simply in terms of when their agricultural subsidies will arrive or when their community funding will arrive and start thinking about what degree of safety the community institutions can offer them . 
i therefore ask you to adopt the proposals contained in the joint motion for a resolution which will be voted on first , or at least those proposed by the socialist group . 
the reactor has been fully shut down as preparations are made to cut out a circular section of the main pipe and to return this to the uk for thorough examination before coming to a final decision as to how best to weld or remove it in the defective pintle area of the ship . 
there is absolutely no immediate danger or emergency of any kind , or any threat posed to the surrounding population of spain . 
the interests of the people of gibraltar and southern spain are identical in this regard . 
chief minister peter caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him . 
the panel has recommended allowing the next stage to proceed , while stipulating that the ministry of defence must fully understand the cause of the defect before commencing the essential repairs . 
repairing a submarine in situ remains by far the safest option available : towing it would not only be dangerous but would , in any event , require considerable repairs to be done beforehand . 
the spanish government has until now shown considerable maturity in its response to this situation . 
i would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the commission that it is not the view of the uk government that the euratom treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind . 
nevertheless , the british authorities have endeavoured to be as open as possible with their spanish counterparts . 
mr president , i will begin by saying that i am andalusian and that i live in andalusia , though i am not so arrogant as to claim that i represent the entire andalusian people , as mr bautista has don. although that arrogance is based on very few votes . 
having said this , we must remember that there has been a lot of contradictory information since may when the nuclear submarine tireless , belonging to the british navy , chose the port of gibralta. which flies the british fla. to have repairs carried out on the cooling system of its nuclear reactor , which , according to the british authorities initially , presented no special difficulty or any danger to the inhabitants of the area . 
further explanations have followed and concern about what was happening to the tireless has been increasing . 
the spanish government , from the outset , has held a position based on two points : the need for transparent information , based on technical and scientific criteria , in order to assess the scope of the repairs and their potential risk ; and also , the view that any decision , either on its repair in gibraltar or on its removal to a naval base in the british isles , be taken in accordance with rigorous technical principles . 
this has been and , in our view , remains , the most coherent position and the one which safeguards the interests and safety of all the parties involved . 
mr president , celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the unhcr is a way of paying our respects to the men and women who offer non - partisan help to freedom fighters throughout the world under what are often very difficult circumstances . 
if we want to help them even more , we should call on the community institutions to increase the financial , human and material resources of the unhcr . 
however , i deplore the way in which several countries , including certain member states , have attacked the 1951 geneva convention . 
must we remind them that 50 roma families from hungary , having had their village ransacked , have been waiting here in strasbourg for a decision on their application for asylum since july ? 
when i recently paid a visit to the burmese camps on the border with thailand , and asked what claimed most victims in those camps , the answer was : violence and suicide . 
the suicide rate is particularly high among young people who can no longer endure their bleak situations . 
the unhcr is also asking for help from the union , which has reduced its financial aid by more than 400 % over the past few years . 
i would ask the commission to re - instate this aid to the unhcr and also to designate the unhcr as the coordinating body in all its contracts with ngos . 
the un refugee organisation has an enormous task ahead . 
let us give this organisation more support , enabling it to better fulfil its role over the next fifty years . 
let us hope that after this christmas period , those millions of refugees and aid workers can look forward to better times . 
mr president , over the 50 - year span that has passed since the unhcr was founded we have seen that , on both sides of the cold war , a system for aid for refugees is needed more desperately than ever . 
the century that has now begun will unfortunately become known as the century of exile . 
the reasons are , to some extent , different to those of half a century ago , but the need for aid is crucial and , furthermore , more globally spread than it was then . 
since the european council in tampere , the eu has made headway in the development of measures connected with asylum and immigration policy and , obviously , the eu must achieve a common strategy to eliminate the reasons why people become refugees and guarantee their humane treatment , irrespective of the country that is taking them in . 
that is not enough , however : we must give our determined support to the unhcr , both in political and economic terms , to ensure there is a balance between the issues of predictability , flexibility and geographical location . 
we are paying our respects today to the unhcr and to all humanitarian workers . 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees and other humanitarian organisations work together , helping refugees to start a new life in a new country or , where possible , to return home . 
the unhcr is currently helping 5 million displaced persons and some 11.5 million refugees . 
the unhcr has always fought for the protection and welfare of refugees and displaced persons . 
it has taken part in specific operations when asked to do so by the secretary - general or another authority of the united nations , in agreement with the countries concerned . 
in the former yugoslavia and timor , the unhcr has decided to protect all displaced persons and provide humanitarian aid for them , irrespective of whether or not they are refugees . 
it should therefore have access to civil victims and its teams on the ground should be able to work in complete safety and with all the resources needed to carry out their mission . 
on the fiftieth anniversary on thursday , the united nations high commissioner for refugees stated that the long life of the unhcr gave little cause for celebration and that it was more important to pay homage to the millions of refugees , to their courage and to their contribution to the entire world , stressing that refugees were entitled to everyone 's respect . 
we should view the speech made by mrs sadako ogata , the un high commissioner for refugees , as a challenge ; basically what she said was that the long life of the unhcr reflected the international community 's inability to prevent prejudice , persecution , poverty and all the other reasons which result in conflict and movements of populations . 
mr president , i too wish to express my group 's appreciation of the valuable work done by the unhcr , both on the ground and in policy terms . 
there is a desperate need for a body that defends the individual right to asylum and actually looks for best practice in terms of treatment for refugees , not the lowest common denominator and policies of deterrence , which some member states and political parties seem determined to follow . 
there are arguments for including the unhcr in the formal policy process of the union to make the best possible use of their advice and experience . 
as others have said , we also need to ensure adequate funding for this organisation . 
we will continue to follow that model for our proposals on the successor instrument to the dublin convention , conditions to qualify as a refugee on the basis of the geneva convention , and on subsidiary forms of protection . 
the inclusion of high - level protection standards in our proposals is of prime importance to the commission . 
on 22 november the commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the union , which is the final aim fixed in tampere for the common european asylum system . 
our proposals fit into the tampere political guidance , in particular the need for a full and inclusive implementation of the 1951 geneva convention for maintaining the principle of non - refoulement and a balanced approach between the absolute respect for the right to seek asylum and the legitimate aim to control migration . 
they also fit into the comprehensive approach to strengthen partnership with countries of origin . 
the first of what is meant to be a series of regular , strategic programming meetings with the unhcr took place in brussels on 6 december . 
the european commission 's humanitarian aid office ( echo ) presented its strategy for next year , including funding criteria and priorities , and exchanged views with unhcr on humanitarian needs and horizontal issues of common concern . 
these meetings should help the commission provide the more predictable and transparent funding that unhcr requests and has long called for , while at the same time assisting unhcr in rendering a better service to those in need . 
i want to refer to a broader issue that is very relevant to what the honourable member said earlier . 
because of our existing financial regulation , it is extremely difficult for us to provide support to un organisations for example , for programmin. we have to focus on project. and that means that there is sometimes an extremely uncertain profile in our funding of organisations like the unhcr . 
that is why i am extremely keen to see appropriate changes made in our new financial regulation to ensure that we can support programming so that un bodies and other similar organisations can be sure some time in advance of a flow of funds to support work we are doing in common and to which we both attach priority . 
the commission is firmly committed to strengthening the unhcr 's unique protection mandate and to working with the unhcr in enhancing the security of relief workers . 
the commission is also working closely with the unhcr in trying to ensure a smooth transition between relief and development . 
in this regard , the commission participates actively in the unhcr - sponsored brookings process , which will be an important element of the communication on linking relief , rehabilitation and development which is currently being finalised . 
finally , i should like to pay a tribute to all the work that has been done by mrs ogata for the unhcr and to wish mr ruud lubbers well in his new post . 
our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 . 
we demand a swift release of the political prisoners and an impartial inquiry into the whereabouts of the missing persons . 
mr solana , mr patten , i ask you both to put the kostunica regime sufficiently under pressure to ensure these demands are met . 
i would like to say the following to mr kostunica : you would gain in credibility if you were to take advantage of the forthcoming christmas celebrations to carry out such an act of goodwill , which can only benefit stability in the region . 
consequently , all political prisoners in serbia must be freed . 
the injustices committed by milosevic must now come to an end. it is worth repeating that we make the same requirements of the political leaders in kosovo . 
the persecution of minorities can never be justified . 
the new political leadership in serbia must act in such a way , and i would like to point this out , mr president , so that the former president and dictator milosevic , together with his partners in crime , can be brought before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague . 
it is there that milosevic belongs and not at party conferences in belgrade . 
mr president , any objective observer of the situation in yugoslavia is compelled to conclude that the criminals continue to move about scot - free while their victims are locked up in prison . 
for all our delight at the changes in belgrade , we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims . 
this has nothing to do with an amnesty , because it stands to reason that an amnesty can only be granted to prisoners who have been justly convicted ; what we are demanding is quite simply the release of unjustly convicted people . 
that may be linked with an amnesty , or their release may precede the amnesty . 
it is my view that the political prisoners , not least the many hundreds of albanians , must be released without delay . 
i also appeal to president kostunica to find out what happened to people such as mr ukshin hoti , with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts . 
so there is a need to investigate the fate of those who were abducted , whether they were murdered or whether they are still being held somewhere . 
all those who are being illegally detained or who are in prison for political reasons must be released without delay . 
that is the first step towards the establishment of the rule of law . 
in order to establish truly lasting peace between the different groups , it is also necessary to shed light on the fate of the prisoners who have been imprisoned by milosevic simply on the grounds of ethnicity or political views . 
we either expect a clear amnesty law in the short term with specific details or , and preferably in combination with , a concrete date for the release of the political prisoners . 
we believe that within kosovo too , the mentality of ethnic groups which are still fighting each other should make way for mutual respect . 
the way in which kosovar - albanians are currently harassing serbs on serb territory is not helping to defuse the situation on either side . 
what we need now are concrete steps to reach lasting peace . 
mr president , i would like to comment on two points of the joint draft resolution which , incidentally , receives my unqualified support . 
the request to president kostunica to release all political prisoners from the milosevic era , requires , as before , unrelenting diplomatic effort on the part of the european council and commission in belgrade , especially since most serb political prisoners , if not those of albanian origin from kosovo , have , as far as i know , now been released . 
i also agree with the request for help from kfor to thwart further violence in the presevo valley . 
mr president , i am pleased , as i am sure is the whole of parliament , that there has been considerable progress in the political situation in the federal republic of yugoslavia in recent months . 
i am sure we are all pleased about the progress throughout the region in the course of this year , beginning with the electoral change in croatia at the beginning of the year , continuing with the change in the federal republic of yugoslavia and culminating in the extremely successful conference which was quite properly held in zagreb a few weeks ago . 
mr president , the third generation agreements between the european union and the countries of latin america are characterised by the existence of a democratic clause that is the basis for , and supports , all relations . 
there is no need to say that the logical consequence of this clause is the affirmation of the principle of separation of powers as an essential element of the democratic system and of the rule of law , and that this principle means and implies the independence of the judicial powers in their actions . 
however , mr president , i think that today the best support that the european union can give to the process of consolidation of democracy in chile and to the civic maturity demonstrated by the citizens of the country in its transition process , is to have an ambitious agreement for political association , economic coordination and cooperation between the european union and chile . 
in order to do this , mr president , and i am particularly addressing the commission , in my opinion we need to modify the current negotiation directives and overcome a blatant discrimination compared with other geographical areas , which links the conclusion of this agreement with the completion of the negotiations of the new round of the world trade organisation . 
i think , mr president , that it is now time that we moved from words to actions and that we stopped making purely rhetorical statements . 
the best way to express our solidarity and our support for the process of democratic consolidation in chile is clearly , mr patten , and you were there recently chairing the negotiations , through the european union offering our chilean friends an ambitious cooperation agreement . 
mr president , any dictatorship leaves behind it a trail of victims , murdered people , tortured people , people who have spent years in prison and many people who have had to go into exile . 
there are many chileans , for example , who now live in europe as a result of the dictatorship of general pinochet , who came into power by overthrowing a democratic government , who established himself over the dead body of president allende and who , after a long dictatorship , lost power because the chilean people were not prepared to continue supporting him . 
and , on one occasion , general pinochet decided to come to europe and , as soon as he set foot here , the european judicial authorities set out to ensure that general pinochet took responsibility for his actions . 
the chilean government guaranteed that in chile general pinochet would have a fair trial and general pinochet has indeed now lost his immunity and the chilean judicial authorities are initiating proceedings against him . 
here we cannot replace the judicial authority once it has legal power over the case of general pinochet , and we welcome the fact that the chilean government has also decided to allow the judicial authorities to operate . 
the only thing we can do here is to support the chilean government at this time and , taking advantage of the presence of commissioner patten , to ask him , as the previous speaker , mr salafranca , did , for a new agreement to be sought with chile which will help continue to strengthen democracy in that country . 
i think that it is a good opportunity to strengthen our links with the chilean government , to enable the chilean government to authorise the judicial authority to bring proceedings against general pinochet and , at the same time , to take advantage of this opportunity to give our support to the chilean government . 
i recall that in the european parliament mission to argentina , former president alfonsín said to us that sometimes democracies only remember other democracies post mortem , that is , when there is no longer democracy . 
now that we have democracy in chile , let us help that democratic government and democratic nation . 
mr president , before i begin , allow me to mention the attack that took place today in spain , specifically in catalonia , ten kilometres from my own home . 
going on to the subject of chile , i would like to express the confidence , the approval and the satisfaction , on the part of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , that the resolution contains some important points , such as respect for the power of chilean justice , for the government , for allocating responsibility and , above all , being able to provide support from the european union for the democratic process with real and positive agreements . 
we in this group extend our profound solidarity and sympathy to the people of mozambique as we did earlier this afternoon to the people in spain . 
it is significant that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution before us read that parliament condemns any use of violence in political disputes and calls for respect for the rule of law and calls on all the democratic forces in the country to consolidate peace and the democratic process . 
these are words that we should bear in our hearts . 
the peaceful and democratic pursuit of political ends is not just a means to an end ; it is intrinsic in any worthwhile end itself . 
i say that in the knowledge that these are foundational beliefs for the parties of the european free alliance and for the greens in this house . 
i have great honour in commending this motion . 
turkey 
mr president , we in the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left would have liked to have approved a resolution on the human rights situation and the situation in the turkish prisons following this debate . 
we regret that the other political groups were not willing to do so on this occasion . 
as we all know , the serious and systematic infringements of human rights in turkey are continuing . 
the situation in prisons and police stations is entirely unacceptable and includes extensive abuse and torture . 
in recent times a number of people have died as a result of abuse in turkish prisons . 
an extensive hunger strike is currently underway in the prisons to protest against these inhuman conditions . 
turkey is infringing international conventions on human rights to which the country is a signatory . 
the oppression of the political left and national minorities such as kurds is particularly intense , but other national minorities such as assyrians are also being oppressed . 
unfortunately we will be able to see a new example of this on wednesday next week , when the assyrian priest yusuf akbulut will be brought before a military court in diyarbakir . 
his only crime is to have spoken the truth when he spoke about the genocide of armenians and assyrians in the 1920s . 
so long as this situation prevails the country cannot be considered for membership negotiations with the european union . 
mr president , before beginning my speech i would also like to join in condemning the attack that cost the life of someone elected by the people , and of an activist and councillor of the partido popular in catalonia in spain . 
having said this , i would like to talk very briefly about a delicate situation , because in this debate we can be carried away by our emotions and talk forever about the little respect that there is for human rights in turkey . 
but it is also true that the hunger strike is taking place at a time when reforms are under way in the turkish regime , and specifically in the area of prison policy . 
that said , however , i would also like to say that we should not trust the fine words and good intentions , that turke. as has been said her. is still giving no unequivocal signs of respect for human rights , that it has just pronounced an amnesty law that does not deserve that name , that it is still failing to respect the rights of the kurds , that it violates international conventions , that it persecutes leftwing activists , that it tries people for the things that have been mentioned here . 
therefore , what we are kindly asking the commission here is that there should be strict monitoring of the conditions in that country which , of course , does not deserve to be considered to be respecting human rights . 
mr president , the present crisis is founded upon the turkish proposal to transfer prisoners from large wards to smaller prison cells . 
this treatment would be exactly like we see in western europe and , faced with the protests , the minister hikmet sami turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout turkey . 
this is surely the correct approach and fully consistent with the government 's expressed wish to meet the political requirements for the accession partnership with the union . 
for that reason , we oppose the gue / ngl resolution . 
mr president , every country in europe , and france in particular , needs to respond to the distress of prisoners by considering how to reform the methods and structures which govern penitentiary administrations so as to show greater respect for the dignity of prisoners , irrespective of the seriousness of their crime . 
the desire to create prison conditions which are as humane as possible , without resorting to demagogy , is broadly shared and strengthened as and where necessary by the vigilance shown by all the associations working to defend human rights . 
it would therefore appear to be perfectly logical to call on all countries , especially those who are candidates for membership of the european union , to support this move . 
having said that , our debate here today was provoked by our reaction to the hunger strike currently taking place in turkish prisons . 
however , i am pleased that it will not culminate in a righteous recommendation by parliament , which is often perceived to be overly keen on preaching and which would do well , from time to time , to put its own house in order . 
i am pleased because i think that , when it is not a vulgar sham , a hunger strike is a suicidal undertaking which my personal beliefs forbid me from encouraging . 
tunisia 
mr president , allow me to start by welcoming imen derwiche and nourredine ben tisha to the public gallery ; they are young tunisian students who were tortured and imprisoned for several months . 
action is needed quickly , which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda . 
the very existence of the oldest human rights league in africa and the arab - speaking world , the tunisian league , is under threat , despite being recognised by president ben ali . 
judicial proceedings to have it wound up were instituted following its last congress , which appointed directors who are obviously not to the tunisian authorities ' liking . 
its fate is to be decided at a hearing scheduled for 25 december , which is surprising , because this date is also a muslim public holiday this year . 
as we speak , police forces have surrounded the premises of the tunisian national council for liberties and even the private residences of some of its members . 
this police operation has already used force to prevent the national council of the league from meeting in bizerte and the tunisian national council for liberties from meeting in tunis . 
its spokesman , moncef marzouki , risks being sentenced to over 10 years in prison at a hearing the day after tomorrow , on 16 december . 
finally , political prisoners have been on hunger strike in prison , some of them for two months . 
some , such as béchir habid , are in a critical condition . 
their very life is in danger . 
repression is on the rise , arrests and intolerable cases of torture are increasing in number . 
this is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression , association or assembly ; now , freedom of movement , freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one 's choice are difficult to exercise in tunisia . 
men and women are harassed daily and their families harassed as well . 
one example is mehdi zougah , a french - tunisian citizen , who was arrested at tunis airport on 11 august . 
for four months his wife and children have been waiting for him at home in marseilles . 
he will stand trial on 8 january on charges of having attended a meeting of the tunisian opposition in france , which he denies . 
it is a case of the most blatant arbitrariness . 
the tunisian authorities should pay heed to the concern and outrage being expressed in this chamber . 
they should listen to the representative of the un secretary - general for human rights who expressed her acute concern on 7 december , calling for an end to the practice of harassing defenders of human rights . 
the tunisian authorities should realise once and for all that we are determined not to relax our vigilance and to continue to press for fundamental rights to be respected . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , tunisia has undertaken , within the framework of its association agreement with the european union , to respect human rights and democratic principles . 
following numerous violations of human rights in tunisia , parliament adopted a resolution on 15 june 2000 . 
but the facts remain . 
even if a few passports have been returned , even if president ben ali delivered a speech on the freedom of the press and improved prison conditions on the anniversary of his taking power , there has been a marked deterioration in the human rights situation in tunisia . 
the human rights league has been suspended , its premises placed under seal and its president , moktar trifi , has been summoned to appear in court , as you have just heard , on 25 december . 
the secretary - general of the league , khemaïs ksila , who has already spent two years in prison , has been sentenced to a heavy fine which he cannot afford to pay and therefore risks another spell in prison . 
the spokesman of the tunisian national council for liberties , professor moncef marzouki , is due to appear in court this week , on 16 december , and risks ten years in prison . 
the civil association raid attac tunisia , the leaders of which were imprisoned at the beginning of the year , has still not been authorised . 
the aloes publishing house , which has been closed down several times , is prevented from publishing freely . 
the lawyer acting for many political prisoners , radhia nasraoui , cannot visit her clients in prison . 
when militants and those in charge of these associations decide to meet in order to celebrate the anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights , their houses are surrounded by police and anyone trying to enter is harassed in the street by men dressed in civilian clothes . 
these men and women are the sakharovs , the vaclav havels , abraham serfatis and nelson mandelas of our times . 
we should be at their side because they are defending the values which we hold dear and which the tunisian government and authorities have promised to respect under the association agreement . 
we therefore call on the commission to ensure that the terms agreed and undertakings made under this agreement are respected . 
we call on it to intervene as a matter of urgency in the cases which we have cited and which give us the greatest cause for concern . 
finally , we call on the commission to re - examine the conditions under which the meda democracy programme is being applied because we find it incredible that the tunisian authorities have retained a right of control . 
as with the countries of the former yugoslavia , we think that the union should be able to provide direct support to newspapers , publishing houses and independent democratic associations . 
mr president , commissioner , the situation in tunisia gives real cause for considerable concern . 
at least 1 000 people are still imprisoned for the sake of their views . 
human rights activists , trade union members , academics , journalists and students report constant harassment by the authorities . 
ambassadors have protested on behalf of the un . 
members of the organisation are harassed and have been prevented from meeting , with disproportionate police action . 
sympathisers with the movement abroad have been prevented from returning . 
what crimes they are guilty of is unclear and the action should be dropped . 
finally , we are greatly concerned at the condition of those prisoners who are on hunger strike . 
last week one of the prisoners , rached jaidane , fell into a coma . 
his family have been given no information as to his condition . 
the young student béchir habid has been on hunger strike since 18 october . 
however , this requires tunisia to respect agreements entered into , including those which encompass clauses on human rights . 
to discuss these matters i would like the commission to take the initiative to convene an extra meeting of the council on eu - tunisian association in order to discuss the matter of human rights as soon as possible . 
mr president , first of all i would like to express my thanks for the solidarity expressed by other colleagues due to the recent assassination by the terrorist group eta . 
my group , like this parliament , is particularly sensitive about the human rights situation in tunisia and in the rest of the world . 
this concern is behind the fact that , in recent weeks , i have met twice with the chairman of the tunisian human rights league . 
i have also , mr president , had the opportunity to visit the countr. which i did not kno. and during this visit , i have been able to observe that tunisia is a country that has made considerable progress in the economic sphere and in fighting poverty , promoting the emergence of a prosperous middle class . 
there have also been considerable improvements in the access and incorporation of women into political , economic and social life , and i also do not think that we should forget the element of stability and moderation that the country represents in the face of fundamentalism . 
all this does not mean , of course , that this economic progress should not be followed by more progress in the political sphere and that there should not also be progress in the uncompleted reform process , particularly in terms of rights and fundamental freedoms . 
the reforms announced by president ben ali in november are precisely in the spirit and the letter of the last resolution adopted by this parliament , and what is needed now is for them to become a reality . 
for all these reasons , mr president , as well as our irrevocable and undeniable commitment to human rights and to the tunisian league , i would like us to also be capable , in a balanced manner , without being overly positive or negative , of considering the general situation of the country in an objective manner , and of comparing the situation with what other african countries are experiencing , and in particular , its immediate neighbours , algeria and libya , which are not exactly a model of respect for human rights . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is six months since the european parliament passed a resolution calling on the tunisian government to stop violating human rights and to work in support of fundamental freedoms , the rule of law and the development of the civil society . and still the tunisian regime is committing one violation after another and sinking deeper and deeper into generalised police repression . 
the call for a meeting of the association council on the human rights situation in tunisia should be followed by real action.. . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let us not get carried away , please . 
this is the second time that tunisia has stood in the dock before this house and one might well wonder what is behind this tenacity , especially as there appears , in the final analysis , to be almost no justification for it . 
and yet , here is a country which can lay claim to many spectacular successes during its developmen. which is perhaps the first human right . 
plus , tunisia is the first country in the arab league to have abolished bigamy . 
the commission would like to thank the european parliament for the initiative taken in proposing various draft resolutions on the pinochet case and the consolidation of democracy in chile . 
i hope that in this case the chilean justice system will continue to demonstrate independence and effectiveness . 
the government of chile has very wisely refrained from intervening in the independence of the judiciary . 
the commission is , and always has been , fully committed to respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and that is why the commission has lent substantial and tangible support to the process of transition to democracy in chile . 
the negotiations went extremely well and i am delighted that we are picking up momentum in those negotiations , which i hope will have the conclusion which the honourable member referred to . 
this agreement will , as he said , encompass the areas of political dialogue as well as trade and cooperation . 
in accordance with our negotiating mandate , we will insist that the agreement contains a democracy clause which will define respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights . 
we will also ask for the principle of the rule of law to be the basis of the agreement . 
i can already say that the chilean government seems in full agreement with this approach to our negotiations . 
public declarations were made after these events deploring the use of violence and supporting measures to bring to justice those found to be responsible for it . 
we understand that the european union heads of mission have been following the political situation in the country closely . 
they met the minister of foreign affairs on 8 december and we have been in contact with the presidency both in europe and in mozambique to gauge the appropriate level of european union political initiative . 
although i would not want to downplay it , the situation , despite being serious , does not appear to be out of control and there is some concern that outside interference could harm the chances of the two sides reaching some form of negotiated settlement . 
on the other hand , it is important that we insist that the results of the inquiries on all the deaths should be made public and the responsibilities made clear . 
the commission urges the turkish authorities to do their utmost to put an end to this worrying situation . 
we welcome the recent decision by the turkish minister of justice to postpone the transfer of prisoners to f - type prisons , which were well described by the honourable member , for an indefinite period of time and his wish to reach what i understand is called a " social compromise " on this question . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , côte d ' ivoire has got itself into a vicious circle and the situation is going from bad to worse . 
by playing with the concept of ivorian identity in order to exclude mr ouattara from the political scene , the powers that be are paving the way for ethnic conflict . 
it is not just mr ouattara ; rather all the people in the north , all the muslims and anyone with a name which sounds vaguely foreign are subject to persecution and violence . 
the dozens of deaths over recent days make me fear the worse . 
if this policy continues , there will be a bloodbath , just like the bloodbaths we have seen in other countries . 
laurent gbagbo needs to introduce a real policy of national reconciliation by ending the discussion on ivorian identity , revising the racist constitution and holding democratic elections open to all candidates ; otherwise the risk of secession and civil war can only grow . 
how can a legislative election in which only 34 % of the population voted and which millions boycotted claim a legitimate result ? 
we were delighted , commissioner , at the departure of general guei . 
if we wish to safeguard our credibility , we must be firm with laurent gbagbo in refusing to sanction this dangerous , uncontrollable slide off course . 
it is no coincidence that the oau and numerous african heads of state have condemned the concept of ivorian identity outright . 
they know full well that an ethnic or separatist conflict in côte d ' ivoire could throw the entire region into a state of unrest . 
mr president , commissioner , we must not stand by and watch . 
mr president , as the honourable member , mr sylla , has just said , it was with relief that we welcomed côte d ' ivoire 's first steps on the path back to the rule of law with the recent presidential election and the failed attempt to keep general guei in power . 
this hope was matched by the tremendous concern with which we have followed the recent events which have again plunged this beautiful country into bloodshed , with the threat of an ethnic and religious divide between the north and the south . 
we cannot but condemn this step backwards and call on the present leaders to allay fears before the violence and vengeance spiral out of control and cause the sort of devastation provoked by similar forms of discrimination at other points on the planet , including within the very heart of europe , at the end of this century . 
the purpose of the european union is to extend the area of peace and stability which its founding members set up on either side of the rhine fifty years ago to the entire union . 
this has only been possible through reconciliation and by respecting the identity of each of the communities which were once antagonists . 
what was once a dream has become reality . 
this is the challenge which now faces those in power in côte d ' ivoire . 
let us hope that they will have the courage to take it up and we shall spare no effort in helping them do so . 
mr president , for months the news from côte d ' ivoire has been causing justified alarm within european public opinion and the corresponding concern in our parliament . 
that turbulent situation surprised many because it was taking place in a calm and relatively prosperous country , with institutions that functioned reasonably well and with a society living in a satisfactory degree of harmony . 
the traumatic events that have occurred there are a clear demonstration of the process of degradation that the whole of the african continent is experiencing . 
in côte d ' ivoire the degradation has been dramatic in terms of the economy . 
the collapse of cocoa prices , the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices , among other factors , have led to an internal situation of growing tension , a notable decline in the social climate and an increase in unemployment and poverty . 
xenophobia found a good breeding ground in that environment with political forces prepared to use it for their own ends , focused around the concept of ivoirité , and making immigrants that had been established for decades the object of their hateful hostility . 
it was in this context that the military took power , which , as ever , only helped to aggravate the situation . 
violence became widespread , particularly towards the immigrant population or towards natives of the north or neighbouring countries . 
the political process put together to recover democratic legitimacy did not fulfil the hopes that some had placed in its procedures . 
after a more than dubious presidential election , the european parliament was determined to call for the legislative elections of 10 december to be free , fair and pluralist . 
we must now recognise that our demands have not been complied with . 
the most serious thing is that , in 32 constituencies , elections did not even take place , which makes the crisis of legitimacy even more obvious . 
mr president , we cannot subscribe to this condemnation of the xenophobic and ethnic racist policy of the côte d ' ivoire administration without , at the same time , condemning the unspeakable policy of the french government authorities , which not only support the ivorian president and his policies but which are also making diplomatic overtures to various governments on his behalf . 
its leaders , whatever their political hue , have supported in turn the dictatorship of houphouët - boigny , the authoritarian and corrupt bédié regime , the leader of the putsch , general guei , and today gbagbo , a would - be socialist but in fact an out - and - out xenophobe . 
the french state could not care less what ivorian leaders impose on their own people , provided that they faithfully serve the interests of the major french companies in côte d ' ivoire which , both during and after colonialism , have always made huge profits by plundering the country and exploiting its working classes . 
mr president , i am delighted at this opportunity to discuss africa , something we do far too rarely . 
so for once , for pity 's sake , let us refrain from highlighting , or even exaggerating , the rivalries which exist within young , vulnerable african nations . 
the democratic process in côte d ' ivoire is well under way . 
during the debate on the british submarine in gibraltar you indicated that the gibraltar public safety scheme document would be made available to colleagues of the house . 
some half - a - dozen copies are now available from the president . 
mr president , i would like some clarification . 
we were completely in favour of passing a joint resolution at the close of this debate on turkey . 
but , according to my information , all the other groups have withdrawn their motions . 
please be so kind as to confirm that the other groups have indeed withdrawn their motions . 
mr wurtz , i too should like to be as sure as you would like to be , but , in the absence of any written document , i can only be sure they have been withdrawn if each of the political groups formally declares whether or not it is withdrawing its resolution . 
unfair competition could help destroy good shipbuilding environments and lead to the loss of know - how and jobs ; in the long term it could result in a monopoly situation , which would not be beneficial to world trade . 
however , we cannot support the specific proposal to extend the scheme of operating subsidies for up to 2 years . 
i do not blame those present but rather those absent . 
at this rate , we will soon be unable to meet on a thursday afternoon if so few people take part in the votes . 
i believe we need to do a bit of soul - searching here , and find out how we can ensure that at least a sufficient number attend when we meet on a thursday afternoon . 
i shall take your speech as an appeal for more assiduous attendance . 
( the minutes were approved ) 
this issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part , and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile , substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and , most importantly , to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource : first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource , a cultural resource and , lastly , that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations . 
these are the factors that motivated the entire committee on employment and social affairs and i to develop this resolution and enabled us to approve the result unanimously . 
i therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions , including those made at the amendments stage , and also the committee 's experts , for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution . 
the european union took the problem on board in 1999, the year in which the united nations proclaimed the international year of older persons . 
we therefore need extensive training to be available , non - discrimination in the workplace and non - discrimination during the time after retirement as well , when these workers , these people can enjoy the new wealth and new opportunities provided by all the time now available to them and live more serene lives . 
this is why we are moving in this direction and , in particular , why we are considering the older and very old people who , sadly , are liable to be affected by physical problems . 
indeed , as we are aware , health does not last forever . 
the member states must implement different policies to support these people , tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses , especially for those invalids whose families are , in effect , unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term . 
mr president , because of the demographic changes taking place in european society , we are forced to reconsider the role of older people , taking a holistic and long - term approach which aims to keep the elderly active or reintegrate them into working life , be it in a productive process or in the form of social action . 
this approach must include the guarantee of a dignified , independent , self - sufficient lifestyle . 
this sort of strategy calls for well - coordinated objectives and is based on intergenerational solidarity , respect and recognition of the different roles which citizens play . 
the problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time , as the european union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress , the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens . 
these challenges are common to all european societies , albeit to some more than others ; this applies in particular to my own country , greece , which has the highest proportion of poor pensioners : around 31 % according to eurostat . 
we were delighted that the european council in nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the member states will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures , such as lifelong learning , which ensure that they have an active lifestyle . 
my political group has worked closely with the rapporteur , mrs sbarbati , and we are grateful to her for that . 
the report contains numerous common positions . 
we felt that it was particularly important to study the ageing phenomenon within various categories of older persons , because we realised that the elderly in towns face different problems from the elderly in island or rural areas of the european union . 
we particularly supported the involvement of the elderly in various forms of voluntary work , without overlooking the need for social security in these areas , and we believe that the european institutions and the member states should not miss the opportunity of conducting a broad information and awareness - raising campaign directed both at the government agencies responsible for applying social policy and society as a whole , because the citizens themselves must realise that a society needs intergenerational solidarity . 
supporting the european commission 's initiative and enriching it through dialogue with parliament will , i think , send a message to the people of europe that the european union is in a position to forecast change and crisis and to create a society of participation , cohesion and solidarity . 
mr president , i am very pleased to speak on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report . 
this is a most important topic , especially with a growing ageing population in europe . 
the solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard . 
one should emphasise that unity , not only between nations and regions but also between people , is an area in which the european union has a very proud record , and this report emphasises that fact . 
low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the european parliament should have tackled far earlier . 
i am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers : this is an initiative that is welcome . 
promoting life - long learnin. a topic that has already been mentioned by another speake. is a matter i also support . 
with new technology and distance - learning possibilities open to older people , real , new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this . 
on social protection policies : in its work programme for 1999, the commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement , to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible . 
on policies against discrimination and social exclusion : the social action programme sets out the commission 's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new community action programmes based on articles 13, 129 and 139, as modified in amsterdam , and that is something we all welcome . 
the attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report . 
over the past decade in central and eastern europe , we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate . 
the shortage of employees in a growing economy puts pressure on older people to stay in their jobs for longer . 
in fact , this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it . 
that is a development in the wrong direction . 
needless to say , people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things , but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours . 
these people are far more useful as a bonding agent in society who help others function more efficiently . 
it is precisely in voluntary work that they can pass on their life experience and promote cooperation in their own living environments . 
by forcing them to continue in paid work , they cannot fulfil those useful tasks , and it is likely that their life expectancy will be reduced if we impose obligations such as these on them . 
she urges community action , whether that is appropriate or not . 
to my great surprise , the report does not contain any specific recommendations on this matter . 
many member states will need to go on a serious economy drive and prioritise the setting up of funds in order to keep the cost of pensions affordable and to keep the rise in gross average earnings within limits . 
it is exactly the life experiences and wisdom of the elderly which we need in our here - today - gone - tomorrow society . 
we need to change our pattern of thought right across the board . 
the basis for this outlook on life is the family , in which each human being grows up . 
mr president , the commission communication is , i think , a milestone in the history of social policy because it marks the end of a period in which senior citizens were seen as a generation of outcasts or veterans . 
the rapporteur , who has examined the subject with a great deal of sensitivity , points out that we need to combat negative stereotypes and consolidate equality between the generations as a basis for a european social model . 
thanks to her proposals for an active old age , society is enriched by a whole generation . 
encouraging the elderly to take up roles which they can fulfil on a voluntary basis will help overcome the objections of trades union , which view any extension of working life with suspicion . 
at the same time , the report encourages us to revise other policies designed solely for younger generations and aims to awaken the interest of other age groups by redefining the participation of all ages in local economic and social life and redistributing income between them . 
this ambitious objective calls for a radical change in practices and the active involvement of the social partners . 
however , because the elderly do not form a homogenous group , as the communication rightly points out , it is mainly up to the social partners to put forward a system of classification of elderly people which meets modern requirements . 
it quite rightly combines this policy with the policy for the viability of pension systems . 
the redistribution of resources implied in the policy to modernise pension systems , an explosive problem , represents a further aim of the new policy for all ages . 
the proposal to make pension systems dependent upon demographic change in order to create a self - sustaining system is linked to a high level of employment among the elderly . 
however , extensive early retirement and various graduated terms of retirement presuppose a massive revision of these policies because not all of them are socially inspired . 
i should like to close with a word on medical care . 
a quality of life policy depends directly , especially in the case of the elderly , on the quality of medical care . 
the communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death . 
the report is entitled ' promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity ' , an aim we can only endorse . 
future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health - and care - related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing . 
finally , part of the fifth framework programme for research provides for investigations into issues associated with old age , including the effects on health of an active lifestyle in old age . 
it is therefore clear that the political paradigm of active ageing is reflected in many important initiatives and we can safely assume that it will inspire a raft of further initiatives in the future . 
with your permission , i will , in conclusion , respond to a number of points where parliament has expressed concern about the effects of the measures proposed by the commission . 
a constantly recurring concern in your report was whether an emphasis on political measures promoting active and healthy ageing did not necessarily mean poorer conditions and fewer rights for people in need of care , for the very old and for those unfit for work . 
i should like to give you explicit assurance that this is certainly not the commission 's intention . 
quite the opposite : in the communication , the commission has laid great stress on the assertion that political measures should address the differences between people . 
early retirement must remain an option for those who are no longer fit to work . 
not everyone can or should retire voluntarily from working life . 
there must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions . 
mr president , this is the last explanation of vote of the year 2000 and i would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the other presidents for your patience in listening to me throughout the year . 
the year 2000 did not start off on a good note for carlo fatuzzo : in the spring my wallet and credit cards were stolen in barcelona , during the summer my new bicycle was stolen in strasbourg and in the autumn my diary and address book were stolen in brussels . 
however , today the sbarbati report which helps the elderly has been adopted , and this has raised my spirits and brought a smile back to my face . 
all agricultural products will need to be promoted . 
unfortunately , the committee on agriculture and rural development has rejected this proposal . 
my group has re - submitted it under amendment no 27, and i would like to recommend it to you warmly . 
in addition to the standard promotion activities , we believe that a number of aspects will need to be highlighted . 
firstly , it should be pointed out how good agricultural products , such as fruit , milk etc. are for you . 
another aspect to be highlighted is the animal - friendly and environmentally - friendly production methods used in europe . 
how can we explain to european farmers that they are to be ever more restricted in their activities and that they should employ animal - friendly production methods , while at the same time our borders remain open to products from farmers who do not need to use these methods ? 
we need to emphasise the european aspects to the general public . 
the committee on budgets already holds the view that if , in the context of the wto negotiations in 2003 or later , a number of export refunds and other export amounts are reduced , the european commission should ensure that a portion of those refunds and amounts are ploughed back into further promotion activities . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the wto working group and as someone responsible , in particular , for small and medium - sized enterprises , i can only congratulate the commission on this report and on this initiative , because it is far - sighted in already anticipating developments , which bodes well for the future . 
in the wto negotiations we will come under strong pressure to reduce export refunds , and cuts in this sector will be very likely . 
that is why it is very important to achieve a balance here , and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures . 
this sector is , of course , included in the " green box " , and it would , of course , make it possible for us to present european products on the world market in an entirely new and much more intensive way . 
i see great opportunities for quality european products here . 
ultimately this is also support for rural areas , on which , after all , we spend 10 % more today , a sign that these regional economies should also be receiving more support , so that , on the one hand , the theory " think global , act local " can very well be asserted but , on the other , the world market is not disregarded either . 
it is precisely in the food secto. but also in the agricultural non - food products secto. that we have good opportunities in the future here , and we should therefore make the most of them . 
this means , then , that , in the future , the existing 12 categories of products will not be the only ones to be the subjects of promotional campaigns but that the arrangements will be extended to all agricultural products . 
so , mrs lulling , there will be opportunities here in the future not only for grape juice but also for wine . 
a trend which has become increasingly pronounced recently is e - commerce . 
i believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products . 
it is expected that , by the year 2003, 80 % of the european population will in all likelihood be connected to the internet . 
obviously , this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant , and new opportunities are emerging which , at the end of the day , need to be taken . 
another important area is , of course , further education and training . 
i should just like to add , at this time when bse is highlighting a number of abuses in forms of agriculture which place the emphasis on high productivity , that it is especially appropriate to raise the profile , within the internal market , of the specific qualities of agricultural products by including , as the rapporteur suggests , indications of production methods . 
for , while european agriculture may reasonably expect to be a force to be reckoned with on international markets , the fact nonetheless remains that its future is still linked to a greater extent to penetration of its own internal market , which comprises 370 million consumers today and will probably number almost 500 million tomorrow . 
from this point of view , campaigns for information provision and promotion , cofinanced by the european union and the member states , are essential both to help restore the somewhat tarnished image of agriculture in the eyes of consumers and , moreover , to bring about recognition of the excellent quality of the very great majority of our agricultural products . 
of course , such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors . 
there must be periodic campaigns targeted at specific populations or consumers in general in order to highlight aspects relating to , for instance , food safety , traceability , nutritional quality , the specific characteristics of production methods , or indeed the efforts made to promote animal welfare . 
and while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers , we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves , who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them . 
i think it is wrong in principle to have such measures in the european union . 
this is properly a matter for producers , retailers and trade associations , not the european union . 
i think we ought now to have taken the opportunity to phase out the system rather than change and consolidate it . 
i believe it is the fault in the system that ought to be tackled . 
no special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand , and the latter must not be advertised . 
it appears that i am having the last word here not only in this debate but in the millennium from the floor of this house , so he would be quite proud of me if he was still alive . 
in any case , we have had widely divergent views expressed here . 
i want to congratulate the commission on bringing forward this proposal . 
the rapporteur has researched this area very thoroughly and made an excellent report even if i might not agree with all of it , and he pointed out that it seems we did not do so well in the past . 
spending under the last programme actually fell between 1997 and 1998 . 
we have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the european union to take up the money that was available . 
obviously , we have some learning to do . 
i agree that we should spend money on this subject . 
everyone has sufficient food , so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product . 
the european commission has to be extremely careful . 
if dairy products and beef , on which we spend an awful lot of money and indeed sheepmeat as well , although we do not have surpluses of it , are advertised with public money to compete with products which are not subsidised like pig meat and poultry meat , then obviously we are upsetting the balance of the market and doing an injustice to some of our producers . 
we must be extremely careful about that . 
mr rübig points out that there are so many things we can sell abroad . 
that is extremely important because , as time goes by , we will not be allowed to continue our old practice of producing low - quality products and selling them highly - subsidised , unprocessed and with no value added on foreign markets . 
all we can say to amendments nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up , and amendments nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought , is that the commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions . 
overall , i am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support . 
mr president , in my speech i simply ran out of time before i could wish colleagues a merry christmas and a happy new year . 
i should like to do so now . 
the second point that i wanted to make is that despite the critical remarks which , as you know , i also made clearly in my speech , we are glad that this report has been adopted and that the commission is getting this scheme off the ground . 
because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary , but also right , to promote the european model of agriculture . 
all those who say that you can still tuck in in style in europe are right . 
now that we are all convinced that we need to reach a turning point in agricultural policy , i hope that we will also sit down together and do our homework so as to put right these small details , something which is urgently necessary . 
season 's greetings to you all ! 
thank you , mr graefe zu baringdorf , for your good wishes . 
we must promote the moderate consumption of wine , whose medicinal properties have been known since ancient times . 
in those times , the rule of saint benedict required monks to drink one ' hemina ' , or about half a pint , of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion . 
please think of the extra few seconds that i gave you , mrs lulling , as your christmas present . 
mr president , today 's vote actually shows that important issues are also dealt with on fridays . 
this is the last friday sitting in strasbourg for the time being , which means that strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings . 
i believe that the issues which have been debated at these friday sittings have definitely been of strategic significance for europe . 
i should like to make one further request of the french presidency : that mr moscovic. because he has given really extremely brief and sometimes imprecise answers to questions her. answer these questions fully and in writing for the european parliament , because for us , good cooperation between the council and the european parliament means that we face each other as equals and that each takes the other seriously . 
that is why i would also be interested to know whether the issue of friday sittings was discussed at the nice summit , that is whether it was of importance or insignificance to the french presidency . 
finally , i should like to extend my warmest thanks to the house , to all of my colleagues , to all of the ushers and also to the president . 
i wish all of you a merry christmas and a happy new year and hope that we will all meet again next year in good health . 
mr president , i can already answer mr rübig 's question . 
in a bit of horse - trading , mr chirac promised the belgian prime minister that , from now on , all summits will be held in brussels and that there will also be an additional plenary week in brussels . 
i find this really quite dreadful : it contradicts the letter of the treaty , and i hope that it will not happen . 
i would like to commend the rapporteur on his work . 
it should not just be edible agricultural products which are in the limelight . 
we must continue to refer to the internal market principles in our policy , including public health . 
i am pleased with the fact that non - food products , in addition to food products , are now being taken into consideration . 
i can fully concur with the view taken by my colleague , mr jan mulder , in this respect . 
however , in the long run , we will need to aim for an independent agricultural sector which can survive on its own within the market . 
finally , i would like to extend seasonal greetings to everyone , especially those few who have taken the trouble to attend this last friday session of the year 2000 in strasbourg , and to wish you all a good and , above all , wise new century . 
adjournment of the session 
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned . 
( the sitting was closed at 11 a.m ) .
