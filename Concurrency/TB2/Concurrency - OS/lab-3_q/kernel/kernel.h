 *
 * - a type that captures each component of an execution context (i.e.,
 *   processor state) in a compatible order wrt. the low-level handler
     preservation and restoration prologue and epilogue,
 * - a type that captures a process identifier, which is basically an
 *   integer, and
 * - a type that captures a process PCB.
