<h1>Server Description</h1>

<p>
    The server that you will be using to play games over a network is split into two
    modules (<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html">more info</a>). These are called the
    <strong>PlayerServer (player_server.js)</strong> and the <strong>GameServer (game_server.js)</strong>.
    One way to think of these is to consider them as Classes although it doesn't work quite the same as in Java.
    The modules are able to work independently of each other. However, to be able to play a game over the server,
    they will need to be wired up together in the correct way. This is done in the SimpleServer module (server_service.js).
</p>

<h3>PlayerServer</h3>
<p>
    The player server is the part of the server which handles incoming messages from players
    (people who are playing the game). The two types of messages that the player server needs
    to be able to handle are 'registrations' which are message from the player that they wish to join
    a game, and 'moves' which are messages from the players that detail a move that they want to make.
</p>

<h3>GameServer</h3>
<p>
    The game server is the more complex of the two modules and handles incoming messages from a judge. The judge
    is a Java client which drives the game forward, prompting players to make moves, checking the moves are
    valid and sending messages to the players to let them know when the game has finished.
</p>

<h3>SimpleServer</h3>
<p>
    The role of this module is to link up the PlayerServer and the GameServer so that the messages are passed between
    them in the correct way. To do this you will need to apply listener functions to the various events that are emitted
    from the two modules. The relevant events are: player_server.on('register'), player_server.on('move') and
    game_server.on('initialised').
</p>


<h1>Communication between the server and the clients</h1>
<p>
    All communication to and from the server is done using JSON strings. Each JSON string will contain a 'type'
    property which specifies the command. For each different types of messages there will be a specific set of
    data that is needed for the message to be processed. For example: '{type: "INITIALISE", game_id: 4}'.
    On the Java side, these strings are serialised into message objects. On the server side, the type property
    is checked and the relevant action taken.
</p>


<h1>Testing your server</h1>
<p>
    Similar to your previous coursework, we have provided you with a suite of tests with which you can check that
    your program is working as required. As the server is written using Node JS we are using the
    <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> testing framework as well as the <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a>
    assertion library. Mocha and chai are not installed by default on the lab machines but you can install
    them in the following way:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the server folder <code>&ltyour folder&gt/scotlandyard/server</code></li>
    <li>Use the command <code>npm install mocha</code></li>
    <li>Use the command <code>npm install chai</code></li>
    <li>Run the tests using <code>./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha</code></li>
</ol>


<h1>Test Descriptions</h1>

<h2>PlayerServer (player_server.js)</h2>
<p>The first set of tests will require you to fill out the stub functions in the 'player_server.js' file.</p>

<h3>Test 1: Listen</h3>
<p>
    To pass the first test you will need to tell the 'server' property to start listening when the
    <code>.listen(port)</code> function is called. Check both the node js
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/net.html">documentation</a> and 'game_server.js' for hints on how to do this.
</p>

<h3>Test2: Register</h3>
<p>
    To pass this test your PlayerServer must emit a 'register' event when a connected client sends a register message.
    An example register message will look like '{type: "REGISTER", student_id: "testId"}'. The first thing you will have
    to do is to assign a callback function to handle incoming data from a connected client. This will be done in the
    callback assigned to the net.createServer function. Your assigned callback must then decode the incoming string into
    a JSON object using the JSON.parse function. Once done, you can inspect the 'type' parameter of the JSON object and
    if it is a 'REGISTER' emit a 'register' event. See <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">here</a> for more
    information on event emitting.
</p>


<h3>Test 3: Register</h3>
<p>
    To pass this test you must have passed the 'student_id' that is contained in the incoming register message as one
    of the arguments to the event emitting function.
</p>

<h3>Test 4: move</h3>
<p>
    To pass this test, you must trigger an event when a move message is sent to the server. A move message will look like
    '{type:"MOVE", move { target:5, colour: "Red", ticket: "Bus"}}'. To do this follow a similar set of steps as you
    used to emit the 'register' event.
</p>


<h3>Test 5: Move</h3>
<p>
    To pass this test you must make sure that when a move event is triggered, the move part of the message is passed
    as an argument to the emit function.
</p>

<h2>SimpleServer (server_service.js)</h2>
<p>The second set of tests will require you to fill out the stub functions in the 'server_service.js' file</p>

<h3>Test 6: initialised</h3>
<p>
    After the server has started up, it will expect a judge to connect to the GameServer and initialise a new game
    with a game id. When this has happened, the GameServer will emit an 'initialised' event with an argument that
    contains the game id. To pass this first test, you will need to add a function that listens for 'initialised'
    events from the GameServer, and set a variable in the SimpleServer to hold the value of the id. For this test
    to pass you will need to return the game id from the simple_server.gameId() function.
</p>

<h3>Test 7: register</h3>

<p>
    For a player to register that it intends to join a game, it uses the register method. If you have completed the
    tests prior to this, your PlayerServer should be emitting events when a player does this. For the next few tests,
    you will need to add a function to listen for 'register' events from the PlayerServer and process them properly.
    Part of the registration process requires the assignment of colours to registering players. To pass this first test
    you must extract a colour from the array of colours held in the simple server. You should always extract from the
    beginning of the list. After extracting it you must remove the extracted colour from the list.
</p>

<h3>Test 8: register</h3>
<p>
    After selecting a colour for the registering player, you must register that player with the GameServer. To do this
    you should call the game_server.addPlayer(player, colour, game_id) function. NOTE The player argument must be the
    actual socket that the has made the request to register.
</p>


<h3>Test 9: move</h3>
<p>
    When a game is in progress, the players will be sending the judge moves that they have decided to make. Again, if
    your previous tests are passing, your PlayerServer will be emitting events when it receives a move message from a
    player. To make this test pass, you will need to add a function to this 'move' event and pass the move into the
    game server using the game_server.makeMove(player, move) function.
